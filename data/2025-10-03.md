### [1] [Uncovering Implicit Bias in Large Language Models with Concept Learning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01219)
*Leroy Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过上下文概念学习实验发现，大型语言模型在量词理解上存在向上单调性偏好，这种偏见在直接提示测试中不明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示大型语言模型中存在的隐含偏见，特别是通过概念学习任务来发现那些在直接测试中不易察觉的偏见模式。

Method: 使用上下文概念学习实验，通过概念学习组件来测试语言模型，并与直接提示方法进行对比。

Result: 发现语言模型在量词理解上表现出向上单调性的偏见，而这种偏见在直接提示测试中不太明显。

Conclusion: 上下文概念学习是发现语言模型中隐藏偏见的一种有效方法。

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [2] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张从静态数据集转向开放式交互式语言发现范式，通过人机对话动态学习低资源语言，结合模型认知不确定性和人类犹豫信号来指导交互学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言NLP面临文本语料缺乏、标准化拼写困难和标注流程难以扩展的挑战。现有大语言模型依赖海量预收集数据和集中式基础设施，难以为弱势语言社区所用。

Method: 提出基于联合人机不确定性的框架，结合模型的认知不确定性和人类说话者的犹豫提示、置信信号，指导交互、查询选择和记忆保留，实现参与式、协同适应的学习过程。

Result: 这是一个立场论文，提出了理论框架和愿景，而非实证结果。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新思考AI如何与人类知识在未充分记录的语言中互动，从提取式数据收集转向参与式、协同适应的学习过程，尊重并赋能社区，同时发现和保护世界语言多样性。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

### [3] [Discourse vs emissions: Analysis of corporate narratives, symbolic practices, and mimicry through LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01222)
*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型分析828家美国上市公司气候信息披露，发现风险导向叙述常与明确承诺一致，但量化目标与语气脱节；大型高排放企业披露更多承诺但目标不一致；披露风格相似性高，显示模仿行为降低决策有用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化增加了对企业气候信息披露透明度和可比性的需求，但模仿和象征性报告往往削弱其价值。需要评估企业披露成熟度以提升信息披露质量。

Method: 开发多维框架，使用针对气候沟通微调的大型语言模型，通过四个分类器（情感、承诺、具体性和目标雄心）从可持续性和年度报告中提取叙述指标，并与企业属性（排放量、市值、行业）关联。

Result: 风险导向叙述常与明确承诺一致，但量化目标与语气脱节；大型高排放企业披露更多承诺和行动但与量化目标不一致；披露风格高度相似，显示模仿行为。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在ESG叙述分析中具有价值，需要更强有力的监管将承诺与可验证的转型策略联系起来。

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

### [4] [Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224)
*Tyler J Poore,Christopher J Pinard,Aleena Shabbir,Andrew Lagree,Andre Telfer,Kuan-Chuen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估三种兽医专用LLM工具在肿瘤记录总结中的表现，发现Product 1表现最佳，并验证了LLM作为评估者的可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床应用中日益普及，但在兽医学领域的性能尚未充分探索，需要评估兽医专用LLM工具的有效性。

Method: 使用标准化兽医肿瘤记录数据集，通过评分框架评估三种商业兽医LLM总结工具在五个维度上的表现，并测试评估框架的可重复性。

Result: Product 1表现最优，中位平均分4.61，在事实准确性和时间顺序方面获得满分；LLM评估者显示出高可重复性，标准差很小。

Conclusion: 兽医专用商业LLM工具很重要，LLM作为评估者的方法是评估兽医学临床NLP总结的可扩展且可重复的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

### [5] [ClaimCheck: Real-Time Fact-Checking with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01226)
*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck是一个基于小语言模型的自动事实核查系统，通过模块化流程实现高效的事实验证，在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的准确率，超越使用更大模型的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统依赖大型闭源模型和静态知识库，存在计算成本高、透明度低的问题。ClaimCheck旨在开发一个使用小语言模型和实时网络证据的透明、高效的事实核查系统。

Method: 采用分步验证流程：网络搜索查询规划、基于网络的证据检索和总结、证据合成和重新检索、声明裁决评估。每个模块都针对小语言模型进行优化，使用提示策略克服小模型的限制。

Result: 使用仅4B参数的Qwen3模型，在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的准确率，超越了使用LLaMA3.1 70B和GPT-4o等更大模型的先前方法。消融实验表明模块化设计和提示策略有效克服了小模型的局限性。

Conclusion: 精心设计的模块化架构和提示策略可以使小语言模型在事实核查任务中达到甚至超越大模型的性能，同时显著降低计算需求，提高系统透明度和可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

### [6] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文质疑现有数学基准测试对LLM推理能力的评估，指出可能因数据污染和问题类型单一而高估模型能力，并提出了新的EEFSUVA基准来更全面评估数学推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准主要基于IMO等知名竞赛，可能存在数据污染问题，且问题类型单一，无法全面评估LLM的真实数学推理能力。

Method: 引入EEFSUVA基准，该基准收集自东欧和前苏联国家的区域性奥林匹克竞赛题目，这些题目难度与IMO相当但解题方法非标准化，且在在线语料库中较少出现。

Result: 初步结果显示，即使是当前最先进的LLM在EEFSUVA基准上的表现也明显低于其他奥林匹克风格基准。

Conclusion: 需要更广泛的评估数据集来全面评估数学推理能力，并为未来模型开发提供指导。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [7] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在遵循分层指令时存在系统提示与用户输入冲突的问题，模型更倾向于服从社会线索而非系统指令，机制分析揭示了冲突检测与解决的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型应该遵循分层指令（系统提示优先于用户输入），但现有研究表明模型经常忽略这一规则，而更倾向于服从社会线索如权威或共识。

Method: 使用线性探测分析冲突决策信号的编码位置，通过直接对数归因揭示内部冲突检测机制，并进行向量引导实验验证模型行为。

Result: 系统-用户冲突和社会冲突形成不同的子空间，系统-用户冲突检测更强但解决不一致，社会线索能一致解决冲突，引导向量意外地以角色无关方式增强指令遵循。

Conclusion: 研究解释了系统服从的脆弱性，强调需要开发轻量级的分层敏感对齐方法来解决指令冲突问题。

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

### [8] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Rerankers with Synthetic Data and LLM-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01229)
*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需人工标注的文档重排序方法，使用LLM生成合成查询并标注正负样本对，然后通过对比学习微调小型transformer模型，在降低计算成本的同时保持强大的重排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文档重排序方面表现出色但计算成本高，而微调小型模型需要大量人工标注数据，这在现实应用中难以获得。

Method: 使用LLM从领域特定语料库生成合成查询，通过LLM分类器标注正负样本对，然后用对比学习和LCE损失微调小型transformer模型。

Result: 在MedQuAD数据集上，该方法显著提升了领域内性能，并在跨领域任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM用于数据生成和监督而非推理，可以在降低计算成本的同时保持强大的重排序能力，为现实部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

### [9] [Geometric Structures and Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Chinese Character Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01230)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用PHATE流形分析系统研究汉字嵌入中的几何模式，发现实词呈现聚类模式，虚词呈现分支模式，几何复杂度与语义内容相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为传统语言学理论提供计算证据，建立语义组织几何分析的新框架。

Method: 使用PHATE流形分析，交叉验证7个嵌入模型和8个降维方法，分析1000多个汉字在12个语义域中的分布，进行123个短语的子网络分析。

Result: 实词呈现聚类模式，虚词呈现分支模式；有意义的字符展现丰富的几何多样性，结构部首坍缩成紧密簇；从基础字符到短语的系统性语义扩展。

Conclusion: 几何复杂度与语义内容相关，为传统语言学理论提供了计算支持，建立了语义组织几何分析的新框架。

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

### [10] [Trustworthy Summarization via Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Awareness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01231)
*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高风险场景下自动摘要的可靠性问题，应对信息过载和高风险决策的需求，避免过度自信的预测，确保关键信息在信息压缩过程中得到保留且风险属性明确表达。

Method: 构建基于条件生成的摘要模型，引入贝叶斯推理建模参数空间不确定性，使用预测分布熵测量生成内容的不确定性水平，应用熵正则化和风险感知损失的联合优化，集成风险评分和调节模块。

Result: 比较实验和敏感性分析验证了该方法在高风险应用中显著提高了摘要的鲁棒性和可靠性，同时保持了流畅性和语义完整性。

Conclusion: 该研究为可信摘要提供了系统性解决方案，在方法层面展示了可扩展性和实用价值。

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

### [11] [Benchmark Profiling: Mechanistic Diagnosis of LLM Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01232)
*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Benchmark Profiling框架，通过分解基准测试性能为10种认知能力，揭示基准测试实际测量的能力组合，解释了为什么性能提升不总是转化为用户感知的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试分数往往高估真实能力，因为它们掩盖了任务实际需要的技能组合。缺乏系统方法来验证基准测试是否真正测量所声称的能力标签。

Method: 结合基于梯度的重要性评分和针对性参数消融，计算能力影响分数(AIS)来量化每种能力对基准测试成功的贡献。

Result: 分析三个指令调优模型在十个基准测试上发现：大多数基准测试依赖多种能力而非单一能力；相似标签的数据集依赖不同的能力组合；代码生成基准测试需要广泛的多技能改进；与任务无关的能力可能负面影响性能。

Conclusion: Benchmark Profiling解释了性能提升为何不总是转化为用户感知能力，为基准测试审计和模型可解释性提供了透明工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

*Shubham Agrawal,Prasang Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMRank是一个提示感知的路由框架，通过提取提示的多维度特征来为每个提示选择最合适的LLM模型，在性能和效率之间实现最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在能力、延迟和计算成本方面的多样化发展，如何为每个提示选择最合适的模型成为关键部署挑战。

Method: 利用从提示中提取的丰富、人类可读特征（任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标、语法线索等），结合轻量级代理求解器的信号，通过神经排序模型预测每个模型的效用。

Result: 在包含36,497个提示的RouterBench数据集上，LLMRank实现了高达89.2%的oracle效用，并提供可解释的特征归因来解释路由决策。

Conclusion: 多维度特征提取和混合排序目标的重要性得到验证，特征驱动的路由为高效透明的LLM部署提供了潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

### [14] [GRPO++: Enhancing Dermatological Reasoning under Low Resource Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01236)
*Ismam Nur Swapnil,Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DermIQ-VLM，一种通过多阶段资源高效方法开发的视觉语言模型，旨在模拟皮肤科医生的诊断过程。主要贡献是GRPO++，用于稳定数据密集的GRPO框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在医学图像分析中由于数据稀缺和高级训练技术计算成本高而导致的结构化推理能力有限的问题。

Method: 采用多阶段训练流程：首先使用GRPO++进行面向推理的疾病识别，然后进行监督微调以获得对话能力，最后使用基于知识图谱的DPO进行对齐以减少事实错误。

Result: 在精心策划的皮肤病数据集上的初步评估显示，相比标准微调方法，该方法带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 验证了该流程作为在资源受限环境中开发专业化、可靠视觉语言模型的可行途径的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

### [15] [Confidence-Aware Routing for Large Language Model Reliability Enhancement: A Multi-Signal Approach to Pre-Generation Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01237)
*Nandakishor M*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于置信度感知的路由系统，在生成前评估模型不确定性，根据可靠性估计重定向查询，显著减少幻觉并降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉问题，生成看似合理但事实错误的内容。现有后生成修正方法计算成本高且无法预防不可靠内容生成

Method: 结合三种互补信号：内部表示与参考嵌入的语义对齐、跨模型层的内部收敛分析、学习置信度估计，统一置信度分数决定四个路径路由

Result: 在知识密集型QA基准测试中，幻觉检测显著改进(0.74 vs 0.42基线)，计算成本降低40%，F1分数从0.61提升至0.82，假阳性率低(0.09)

Conclusion: 从反应性修正转向主动评估的范式转变，为LLM可靠性增强提供了计算高效的方法

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现填充标记（padding tokens）在大型语言模型中并非无害，即使少量填充也会影响模型激活、生成质量、偏见和安全防护，构成部署风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填充标记在LLMs批处理推理中被广泛使用，但实现错误可能导致它们影响计算，这种影响程度尚未被充分理解。

Method: 系统研究三种开源模型系列（Llama、Gemma、Qwen），插入受控数量的填充标记，并沿四个维度评估结果：激活、生成质量、偏见和安全性。

Result: 即使少量填充也会改变隐藏表示，降低较小模型的生成质量，以不可预测的方式改变偏见，并削弱安全防护机制。

Conclusion: 填充不是无害的细节，而是部署中必须谨慎处理的鲁棒性风险。

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

*Juntae Lee,Jihwan Bang,Seunghan Yang,Simyung Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX是一个用于在单设备大型语言模型中高效处理多轮交互中子任务的执行系统，通过重用主任务的KV缓存和注入任务特定指令来减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力增强，单个模型需要处理多样化子任务来更好地响应用户请求。传统方法在切换主任务和子任务时需要重新处理整个对话上下文，产生显著计算开销。

Method: 通过重用主任务的KV缓存，将任务特定指令注入到隔离的侧路径中。子任务执行后通过缓存上下文回滚到主路径，避免冗余预填充计算。还开发了针对小规模模型的分层分类策略来选择子任务。

Result: 实验表明CIFLEX显著降低了计算成本，同时不降低任务性能，实现了可扩展且高效的设备端多任务对话。

Conclusion: CIFLEX通过创新的KV缓存重用和指令注入机制，有效解决了多任务对话中的计算效率问题，为设备端LLM应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

TL;DR: SKYLENAGE提供两个互补的数学基准：SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH（100项结构化诊断集）和SKYLENAGE-MATH（150项竞赛风格套件），用于评估LLM的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在公共数学套件上表现强劲，但前沿分离存在天花板效应，需要更难的推理中心化数学基准。

Method: 创建两个基准：1）100项结构化诊断集，包含长度、数值密度和符号复杂度元数据；2）150项竞赛风格套件，涵盖高中到博士四个阶段七个学科。评估15个当代LLM变体。

Result: 竞赛套件中最佳模型达到44%，次优37%；准确率从高中到博士递减，顶级系统博士到高中保留率约79%。推理集中最佳模型总体81%，最难部分显示领先与中阶模型间存在明显鲁棒性差距。

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE提供难度校准、元数据丰富的困难推理中心化数学基准，可作为未来数学推理评估的参考基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

### [19] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了人工年龄评分(AAS)来衡量AI系统的记忆老化现象，发现大语言模型在会话重置时会保留语义记忆但丢失情景记忆，导致结构性老化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统记忆老化的现象，特别是大语言模型中语义记忆与情景记忆在不同会话状态下的表现差异，旨在开发一个理论基础的评估工具。

Method: 引入人工年龄评分(AAS)作为基于熵的记忆老化度量指标，在25天的双语研究中测试ChatGPT-5，比较无状态和持久交互阶段的表现。

Result: 持久会话中模型能同时回忆语义和情景细节，AAS接近理论最小值；会话重置时语义记忆保持但情景记忆丢失，AAS急剧增加表明结构性老化。

Conclusion: AAS是一个理论基础良好、任务无关的诊断工具，可用于评估人工系统中的记忆退化，基于冯·诺依曼、香农和图灵的理论框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ARGRE框架，通过显式建模毒性转换轨迹，实现稳定精确的奖励引导编辑，显著降低LLM毒性生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时去毒方法由于对毒性-非毒性转换空间探索不足，导致干预不精确，需要更精细的转换建模

Method: 识别非毒性语义方向，在毒性和非毒性表示间插值揭示细粒度转换轨迹，构建自回归奖励模型指导自适应两步编辑过程

Result: 在8个主流LLM上实验，毒性降低62.21%，推理时间减少47.58%，同时保持模型核心能力

Conclusion: ARGRE框架通过显式建模毒性转换，实现了高效精确的去毒，为LLM安全部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

TL;DR: 开发了心理压力本体论(MeSO)，并评估使用大语言模型从文本中提取结构化压力信息的可行性，准确率达到78.2%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的压力信息通常以非结构化文本形式存在，限制了临床效用。需要开发结构化方法来提高压力文档的一致性和可用性

Method: 整合压力理论模型和11个验证过的压力评估工具开发心理压力本体论(MeSO)，使用Claude Sonnet 4从Reddit帖子中提取六类压力相关信息，并进行人工评估

Result: MeSO包含181个概念，LLM正确识别了78.2%的可提取压力项目，所有正确提取的项目都能准确映射到MeSO，但还有24个相关概念未在ontology中表示

Conclusion: 证明了使用本体论指导的LLM进行结构化压力信息提取的可行性，有望提高环境AI系统中压力文档的一致性和实用性

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空模型难以利用描述外部事件的文本信息来预测人类移动性的突然变化，需要一种能够整合文本语义和时空数据的方法。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，LLM智能体自动从复杂在线文本中提取和推理时空相关文本，通过渐进融合架构将细粒度上下文与时空数据结合，利用预训练事件先验丰富事件驱动预测。

Result: 在通过该管道构建的数据集上评估，SeMob相比时空模型在MAE和RMSE上分别最大减少13.92%和11.12%，在事件发生地点和时间附近的时空区域表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: SeMob框架通过整合文本语义和时空数据，有效提升了事件驱动的人类移动性预测性能，特别是在事件相关的时空区域显示出明显优势。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

*Jiaqing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出使用稀疏自编码器(SAE)的top-1潜在特征进行语言模型引导，并引入token-wise衰减策略，在数学推理任务上优于均值激活差异方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有top-k SAE潜在特征包含许多非语义特征（如标点符号），而非语义属性如指令；恒定SAE引导会产生退化输出如重复单词。

Method: 聚焦单个最相关的SAE潜在特征(top-1)，消除冗余特征；引入token-wise衰减引导策略，实现与均值激活差异基线的更忠实比较。

Result: 引导与推理相关的SAE潜在特征可靠地引发逐步数学推理并提高推理质量，功能上类似于添加引导token；在数学推理基准上优于均值激活差异方法，在IF-Eval上表现相当。

Conclusion: SAEs是有效的语言模型引导工具，通过top-1特征选择和衰减策略可以避免退化输出，在数学推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

TL;DR: 提出SSTAG方法，通过文本作为统一表示媒介，结合LLM的语义推理和GNN的结构建模能力，解决图学习中的跨域泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图学习模型通常针对单个图数据集训练，缺乏跨图和跨任务的泛化能力，且依赖大量标注数据。与NLP和CV不同，图结构数据具有异构性和结构多样性等独特挑战。

Method: 采用结构感知的自监督学习方法，通过双重知识蒸馏框架将LLM和GNN共同蒸馏到结构感知的MLP中，并引入内存机制存储典型图表示以整合不变知识。

Result: 实验表明SSTAG在跨域迁移学习任务中优于最先进模型，具有出色的可扩展性，同时降低推理成本并保持竞争力。

Conclusion: SSTAG成功弥合了LLM语义推理与GNN结构建模之间的差距，为大规模文本属性图的跨域泛化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Conclusion: LOCA为创建高质量科学语料库提供了可扩展的有效方法，为科学AI的可靠训练和评估铺平了道路。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant
to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for
moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual
transformer, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA SFT fine-tuning and prompting
techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单次LLM输出的自监督不确定性估计方法，用于表格数据中的实体链接任务，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM在实体链接任务中表现出色，但在实际部署中需要可靠的不确定性估计，而现有的多轮推理方法计算成本高昂，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用自监督方法从单次LLM输出的token级特征来估计不确定性，减少了对多次生成的需求。

Result: 在多个LLM上的评估显示，该方法能有效检测低准确率输出，且计算成本仅为传统方法的一小部分。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM实体链接工作流提供了一种计算成本有限的不确定性估计实用方案。

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

Result: 发现了反映语料中关键叙事和概念的稀疏特征，包括性别、阶级和社会责任等主题。

Conclusion: LLM与SAE结合可作为复杂数据集的可扩展探针，为语料探索、偏见发现和模型可解释性提供新途径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

TL;DR: 该论文质疑当前语音大语言模型偏见评估中使用的多项选择题格式的有效性，发现这种评估方法无法可靠预测模型在其他任务格式中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型的偏见评估主要依赖多项选择题格式，但这种方法假设模型在其他任务格式中表现一致。作者想要验证这一假设是否成立。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器微调三个SpeechLLMs，诱导它们偏好刻板印象、反刻板印象或中性/不确定答案，然后评估这些行为在其他MCQA基准和长格式生成任务中的泛化能力。

Result: 结果显示，MCQA偏见基准测试的表现无法可靠预测其他MCQA基准的表现，更重要的是无法预测长格式任务的表现。

Conclusion: 当前MCQA偏见基准在语音领域显示出有限的跨任务泛化证据，作者提出了评估套件来测量未来模型和基准的行为可转移性。

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

TL;DR: AI Watchman是一个纵向审计系统，用于测量和跟踪大型语言模型的拒绝行为，揭示公司内容审核政策的变化和差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出受到不透明且频繁变化的公司内容审核政策影响，这些拒绝行为反映了公司政策并微妙地塑造公共话语。

Method: 使用包含400多个社会议题的数据集，审计OpenAI的审核端点、GPT-4.1、GPT-5和DeepSeek（英文和中文），并定性分析拒绝形式。

Result: 发现公司政策变化（即使未公开宣布）可被AI Watchman检测到，识别了公司和模型特定的内容审核差异，并对不同拒绝形式进行了分类。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了纵向审计LLM的价值，AI Watchman是实现这一目标的系统之一。

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

TL;DR: 提出了RJE框架，通过检索-判断-探索机制提升知识图谱问答性能，使小型开源LLM也能达到竞争性结果，同时显著减少LLM调用和token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有KGQA方法中检索方法受限于检索质量、代理方法依赖专有LLM的问题，旨在开发更高效、更通用的KGQA解决方案。

Method: RJE框架包含三个核心组件：检索精炼推理路径、评估路径充分性、有条件探索额外证据。引入专门的辅助模块：推理路径排序、问题分解和检索器辅助探索。

Result: 使用专有LLM（如GPT-4o-mini）时优于现有基线，小型开源LLM（3B和8B参数）无需微调即可获得竞争性结果，显著减少LLM调用和token使用。

Conclusion: RJE框架有效解决了KGQA中的关键挑战，为小型LLM在知识图谱问答中的应用提供了可行方案，同时大幅提升了效率。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

TL;DR: 使用零样本分类方法评估6个主流大语言模型的政治偏见，发现所有模型都表现出增强的自由-威权主义倾向，存在推理替代和固定拒绝模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI快速普及，但训练数据偏差、人类偏见和算法缺陷导致的政治偏见问题持续存在，需要系统评估其对政治话语的影响。

Method: 采用零样本分类方法，结合意识形态对齐、主题性、响应情感和客观性四个维度，对6个主流LLM的1800个模型响应进行系统评估。

Result: 所有6个LLM都显示出增强的自由-威权主义对齐，存在明显的推理替代和固定拒绝模式。

Conclusion: AI模型的内在偏见会渗透公共话语，根据地区既有社会政治结构，可能导致从众或极化现象，扭曲政治格局。

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了GPT-OSS-20B模型的拒绝行为，发现通过特定的提示工程（如教育者角色、安全前提和步骤提示）可以将ZIP炸弹任务的协助率从0%提升到97.5%。德语和法语的正式表达比英语更容易绕过安全限制，Linux终端角色扮演能覆盖开发者规则。研究还发现评估API存在漏报问题，不同推理栈的拒绝率差异达5-10个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究社会语用框架、语言选择和指令层次如何影响大型语言模型的拒绝行为，特别是在有害内容生成方面的安全机制绕过问题。

Method: 研究方法包括：对80个种子迭代进行测试，涵盖多个危害领域；使用复合提示（教育者角色、安全前提、步骤提示）；测试不同语言（英语、德语、法语）的正式表达；引入AI辅助强化方法；采用配对轨迹设计测试评估意识。

Result: 结果显示：复合提示可将ZIP炸弹任务协助率从0%提升到97.5%；德语和法语的正式表达更容易绕过限制；Linux终端角色扮演能覆盖开发者规则；AI辅助强化方法可将泄露率降至0%；13%的配对测试中出现不一致协助；OpenAI Moderation API存在漏报问题；不同推理栈拒绝率差异达5-10个百分点。

Conclusion: 结论是当前的安全机制存在显著漏洞，提示工程可以轻易绕过安全限制，语言选择和角色扮演对模型行为有重要影响，评估API的检测能力不足，不同推理环境的结果存在差异，需要更鲁棒的安全机制。

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑模型对代表性不足社区用户的可靠性，测试其在低资源语言环境中的表现和安全对齐。

Method: 使用豪萨语进行红队测试，通过最小提示诱导模型生成有害内容，并进行了61人参与的调查验证毒性认知。

Result: 模型在豪萨语中生成有害、文化不敏感和事实错误内容，错误认为常见杀虫剂和灭鼠剂对人类安全，无法区分生熟食品，使用贬低性谚语构建错误论点。

Conclusion: 这些问题源于语言奖励黑客行为，模型优先考虑目标语言的流畅输出而非安全性和真实性，主要归因于低资源语言环境中安全调优不足。

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

Method: 引入自适应学习见证函数，从训练数据中学习以增强logits-based检测器性能

Result: 在各种数据集和LLM组合中几乎一致地改进了最先进方法，改进幅度最高可达58%

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT通过统计保证和自适应学习显著提升了LLM生成文本检测性能

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

Motivation: LLM部署存在生成有害或不适当内容的风险，需要有效的安全机制。

Method: 渐进式自我反思(PSR)技术，通过多轮自我反思动态修正输出，并引入轻量级预测器自适应调整反思轮数以平衡安全性和计算效率。

Result: 在多个模型上显著降低攻击成功率：Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct从77.5%降至5.9%，Llama-3.1-8B基础版从89.7%降至5.6%，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct从44.4%降至3.8%。

Conclusion: PSR作为可扩展的测试时方法，通过按输入风险配置动态分配计算资源来增强LLM安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

Motivation: 扩散大语言模型中的幻觉问题尚未充分探索，现有针对自回归模型的幻觉检测方法不适用于扩散模型的多步去噪过程。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为动作轨迹，每个动作定义为模型基于前一个中间输出对清理后响应的预测，识别对幻觉响应最具有信息量的子轨迹。

Conclusion: TraceDet通过利用扩散大语言模型多步去噪过程中的关键幻觉信号，有效解决了扩散模型的幻觉检测问题。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes
how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower

Motivation: 虽然代码解释器和搜索等工具增强了LLM推理能力，但缺乏关于如何最优使用这些工具的实用指导，核心挑战在于有效结合文本推理、编码和搜索来解决多样化问题。

Method: 提出TUMIX集成框架，并行运行多个代理，每个代理使用不同的工具使用策略和答案路径，代理基于问题和先前答案迭代共享和精炼回答。

Result: 在关键推理基准测试中，TUMIX相比最先进的工具增强和测试时扩展方法取得了显著提升，在Gemini-2.5-Pro和Gemini-2.5-Flash上平均准确率提高了3.55%，推理成本几乎相等。

Conclusion: 代理多样性和质量至关重要，可以通过使用LLM自动优化代理设计来增强。TUMIX可以在达到足够置信度时停止精炼，仅用49%的推理成本保持性能，进一步扩展可以实现更高性能但成本更高。

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

TL;DR: HiSpec是一种利用早退模型进行中间验证的分层推测解码框架，通过减少验证时间瓶颈来加速大语言模型推理，在保持准确性的同时平均提升1.28倍吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码中验证阶段是主要瓶颈（如3B模型为70B目标模型推测时，验证比令牌生成慢4倍），现有中间验证方法存在训练开销大、内存占用高和准确性妥协的问题。

Method: 利用早退模型进行低开销中间验证，通过跳过层遍历实现令牌早退，并重用键值缓存和隐藏状态在草稿、中间验证器和目标模型之间，同时定期验证中间验证器接受的草稿令牌。

Result: 在各种代表性基准测试和模型上，HiSpec相比基线单层推测平均提升1.28倍吞吐量，最高可达2.01倍，且不损害准确性。

Conclusion: HiSpec通过早退模型实现高效的中间验证，显著加速推测解码过程，在保持准确性的同时大幅提升推理吞吐量。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

*Maithili Kadam,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAG-EQA是一个提示框架，通过将因果事件图转换为自然语言语句注入LLM输入，在事件问答任务中平均提升5%准确率，最高可达18%提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理需要因果或时序推理的事件类问题时表现不佳，需要注入结构化知识来增强推理能力。

Method: 提出TAG-EQA框架，将结构化因果事件图转换为自然语言语句注入LLM输入，包含9种提示配置（3种策略×3种输入模态）。

Result: 在TORQUESTRA基准测试中，相比纯文本基线平均提升5%准确率，零样本设置下最高提升12%，图增强思维链提示有效时最高提升18%。

Conclusion: 因果图可以在不进行微调的情况下增强LLM的事件推理能力，为基于提示的问答提供了一种灵活的结构编码方式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

*Nicolás Aguirre,Ramiro Caso,Ramiro Rodríguez Colmeiro,Mauro Santelli,Joaquín Toranzo Calderón*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义嵌入距离的无结构评估方法，用于低成本、高效地评估语言模型响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型响应评估方法要么成本过高（如LLM-as-a-Judge），要么脱离真实世界条件（如字符串匹配、logprob），需要更实用且经济的解决方案。

Method: 使用语义嵌入距离将目标候选与任意LM生成的文本进行匹配，通过相对低计算成本的嵌入模型（参数少于100亿）实现响应分类。

Result: 在3个数据集和3种不同LM架构上测试，回归得分约0.97，相对于人工标注者的准确率约96%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算成本低且鲁棒的语言模型响应评估方案，在保持高准确率的同时显著降低了计算开销。

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Expert Question Decomposition (EQD)方法，通过两阶段微调框架和奖励函数指导子问题生成，在金融领域复杂定量推理任务中显著提升问答性能，仅需少量训练数据和单GPU即可实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在需要专业知识的领域特定定量推理任务中的挑战，特别是在金融等专业领域中的复杂问答问题。

Method: 构建两阶段微调框架，使用奖励函数评估生成子问题对问答结果改进的有效性，仅需数千训练示例和单A100 GPU进行微调，推理时间与零样本提示相当。

Result: 在金融领域的四个基准数据集上，EQD方法相比现有领域调优模型和高级提示策略表现更优，问答性能提升0.6%至10.5%。

Conclusion: 在领域特定问答中，单一支持性问题往往比详细指导步骤提供更大收益，EQD方法在平衡领域知识和计算效率方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

TL;DR: ReSSFormer是一个递归稀疏结构化Transformer，通过循环推理、自适应稀疏注意力和自组织编码器结构，解决了传统Transformer在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer架构在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面存在挑战，主要由于刚性层堆叠、密集注意力依赖和位置编码限制。

Method: 整合三个创新组件：循环推理与记忆单元(R2MU)实现有界深度迭代推理，自适应稀疏注意力模块(ASAM)实现高效上下文选择，自组织编码器结构(SOES)实现无位置结构归纳。

Result: 在语言建模、多跳问答和结构敏感任务中，ReSSFormer在相同FLOPs和参数预算下持续优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: ReSSFormer展示了在可扩展性、效率和结构灵活性方面的优势，为Transformer架构提供了改进方向。

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLUE是一种基于隐藏状态的无参数验证器，通过分析LLM内部隐藏状态轨迹来验证输出正确性，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM输出的方法存在局限：基于文本的方法容易过拟合表面特征，基于置信度的方法在不校准模型上失效。作者发现隐藏状态包含更丰富的信息，可作为统一验证基础。

Method: 提出CLUE验证器，无训练参数，仅通过计算隐藏状态变化量，基于与历史成功/失败簇的最近质心距离来分类正确性。

Result: 在AIME 24/25和GPQA基准测试中，CLUE持续优于LLM-as-a-judge基线，匹配或超越现代置信度方法，显著提升准确率。例如在AIME 24上，将1.5B模型的准确率从56.7%提升到70.0%。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态轨迹包含可几何分离的正确性特征，CLUE的简单有效证明了这一信号的强度，为LLM输出验证提供了新思路。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs),
Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

significant improvements over baselines, with our best model achieving
substantial gains across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, advancing the state

TL;DR: PureTC-1B是一个针对传统中文优化的1B参数小语言模型，通过三阶段稳定化管道显著减少非传统中文输出，提升语言稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在传统中文应用中存在token级不稳定性问题，模型会不可预测地输出非传统中文字符或切换到其他语言，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 采用三阶段稳定化管道：1) 在传统中文语料上进行持续预训练；2) 使用指令数据进行监督微调；3) 基于传统中文一致性偏好的直接偏好优化，使用参数高效的LoRA适配器。

Result: 在模拟真实使用场景的基准测试中，PureTC-1B相比基础模型将非传统中文输出token减少了51.3%；在命名实体翻译任务中，相比Llama-3B和Qwen-1.5B分别减少了77.2%和57.2%的错误语言token。

Conclusion: 该方法证明即使在1B规模下也能实现稳健的传统中文一致性，提供了一种可复现、仅需适配器且硬件友好的实用方案，可推广到其他非英语语言。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

Motivation: 传统多智能体系统受限于固定的图拓扑结构，缺乏上下文响应能力，导致在不同学术和商业工作负载中效果下降。

Method: 引入AMAS框架，通过动态图设计器组件，利用轻量级LLM适配自主识别任务特定的最优图配置，根据输入特性智能引导查询通过任务优化的智能体路径。

Result: 在问答、数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，AMAS系统地超越了最先进的单智能体和多智能体方法，适用于多种LLM架构。

Conclusion: 上下文敏感的结构适应性是高性能LLM多智能体系统部署的基本要求。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在漏洞，恶意用户可通过操纵输入文本获取不良响应。这些越狱提示旨在绕过安全防护机制，因此需要有效识别方法。

Method: 使用不同机器学习模型区分越狱提示和正常使用，包括微调BERT模型进行端到端训练来识别越狱行为。

Result: 在当前数据集上，微调BERT模型在识别越狱提示方面表现最佳，能够检测使用未见策略的越狱尝试。

Conclusion: 提示结构中的显式自反性可作为越狱意图的信号，微调BERT模型是当前最有效的越狱检测方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

Result: 应用CLASP分析了21个代表性工作，识别了系统的优势领域和持续存在的能力差距。

Conclusion: CLASP和CLC评分为推进功能级性能和衡量闭环安全代理提供了必要的词汇、诊断工具和测量方法。

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

Motivation: 多模态对话摘要任务需要强大的自动评估方法来减少成本和人工努力，但缺乏基于人类标注的元评估基准。

Method: 构建MDSEval基准，包含图像共享对话、摘要和人类标注；提出基于模态间互斥关键信息（MEKI）的过滤框架来确保数据质量。

Result: 识别并形式化了MDS特有的关键评估维度；基准测试显示现有评估方法在区分先进MLLM生成的摘要方面存在局限，且容易受到各种偏见影响。

Conclusion: MDSEval为多模态对话摘要评估提供了首个元评估基准，揭示了当前评估方法的局限性，为改进MDS评估方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

TL;DR: FOR-Prompting是一种非对称推理协议，通过Defender提出答案、Objectioner提出质疑、Host确保一致性的角色分工，实现自我修正，在GSM8K任务上获得22%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理协议如CoT和ToT缺乏外部质疑机制来引发自我修正，需要一种能够通过外部提问促进模型自我修订的方法。

Method: 采用非对称协议：Defender提出答案，Objectioner提出质疑（不直接修复），Host确保一致性和结束对话。纯提示级别操作，无需重新训练。

Result: 在GSM8K上相比单提示提升约22%，与CoT准确率相当，推理和连贯性评分高10%以上；小模型Llama3.2:1b准确率提升约19%；能够无监督修正错误。

Conclusion: FOR-Prompting在无需工具或人工监督的情况下有效提升推理质量，特别适合小模型和本地设备使用，支持大规模质疑引导推理研究。

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否使用组合机制解决组合任务，特别是两跳事实召回任务。

Method: 使用logit lens分析残差流激活，识别两种处理机制：组合机制（计算中间步骤）和直接机制（无中间变量特征）。

Result: 确认LLMs存在组合性差距，识别出两种处理机制，发现机制选择与嵌入空间线性映射存在相关。

Conclusion: LLMs解决组合任务时采用不同机制，组合机制仅在特定条件下出现，与嵌入空间几何特性相关。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

TL;DR: 论文提出在医疗预咨询任务中，由于训练数据的轮次分布不均，导致LLMs产生"格式惯性"问题，即生成重复但诊断信息不足的问题。通过重新平衡训练数据的轮次分布，有效缓解了这一问题。


<details>

Motivation: 医疗预咨询任务中，SFT训练数据的轮次分布偏斜导致LLMs产生格式惯性，即在长对话中生成重复但诊断价值低的问题，影响实际应用效果。

Method: 采用数据为中心的方法，重新平衡训练数据集的轮次分布，以缓解格式惯性问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著缓解了医疗预咨询中的格式惯性问题。

Conclusion: 通过重新平衡训练数据的轮次分布，可以有效解决LLMs在医疗预咨询任务中产生的格式惯性问题，提升模型在长对话中的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

TL;DR: MathLens是一个用于分解多模态推理子技能的基准测试，专注于几何问题，将性能分为感知、推理和集成三个组件，揭示了不同训练方法对各组件的差异化影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型的评估主要依赖聚合准确率，这种单一分数掩盖了模型在哪些方面以及如何改进的细节，需要更细粒度的评估方法来理解模型能力的提升。

Method: 设计MathLens基准测试，将几何问题分解为感知（从原始输入提取信息）、推理（对可用信息进行操作）和集成（选择相关感知证据并在推理中应用）三个组件，并提供视觉图表、文本描述、控制问题和感知技能探针等注释。

Result: 分析发现：强化学习主要增强感知能力，文本SFT通过反思推理间接改善感知；推理能力仅与感知能力同步提升；集成是最薄弱的能力；强化学习在图表变化下提高一致性，而多模态SFT因过拟合降低一致性。

Conclusion: 多模态推理的不同子技能需要针对性的训练方法，集成能力是当前的主要瓶颈，未来工作应关注提升模型的集成能力。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

TL;DR: 将工程设计标准中的信息转化为模块化、可重用的机器可解释本体，用于工厂设计和设备选择过程中的质量保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管工业工作数字化是目标，但产品规格、产品类型数据表和设计标准仍以文档为中心。需要将这些信息转化为机器可解释的格式以实现自动化验证。

Method: 使用建模模式创建模块化本体，基于国际管道、材料和阀门设计标准。这些模块采用W3C兼容格式存储，并与顶层本体ISO DIS 23726-3工业数据本体对齐。

Result: 成功测试了基于国际标准和行业规范创建的本体在阀门选择过程中的应用。能够自动验证特定阀门数据表是否符合相关行业标准，并使用语义推理确定产品类型是否满足阀门规格。

Conclusion: 创建基于IDO的共享、可重用模块化本体使语义推理能够应用于设备选择过程，展示了这种方法对于希望过渡到数字化智能标准的标准机构的潜力。

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Refusal Index (RI)指标，通过拒绝概率与错误概率的Spearman秩相关性来准确衡量LLMs对未知问题的拒绝能力，解决了现有指标在测量知识感知拒绝能力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标无法准确衡量LLMs的知识感知拒绝能力：简单拒绝指标受拒绝率偏差影响，而现有校准指标是代理指标，无法反映模型的实际拒绝行为。

Method: 设计RI作为拒绝概率与错误概率的Spearman秩相关，并提出轻量级两轮评估方法，通过两次标准评估运行中的观察拒绝率来有效估计RI。

Result: 在16个模型和5个数据集上的实验表明，RI能准确量化模型在事实任务中的内在知识感知拒绝能力，且在不同拒绝率下保持稳定，提供一致的模型排名。

Conclusion: RI揭示了LLMs事实性的重要但被忽视的方面：虽然LLMs在事实任务中准确性高，但其拒绝行为可能不可靠和脆弱，需要将传统准确性指标与RI结合进行全面的真实性评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了16种无监督指标在从俄罗斯司法判决中提取语义块的质量，发现词频一致性和覆盖率/块完整性指标与专家评分最一致，而法律术语密度呈负相关。LLM评估分数表现中等，表明无监督指标可用于可扩展筛选但不能完全替代人工判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能在法律自然语言处理中的快速发展，需要可扩展的方法来评估从司法判决中提取文本的质量，特别是在缺乏预标注真实数据的情况下。

Method: 使用16种无监督指标评估从1000份匿名俄罗斯司法判决中提取7个语义块的质量，包括文档基础、语义、结构、伪真实数据和法律特定类别指标，并与7168个专家评分进行验证。

Result: 词频一致性（Pearson r=0.540）和覆盖率/块完整性（Pearson r=0.513）与专家评分最一致，法律术语密度呈强负相关（Pearson r=-0.479），LLM评估分数表现中等（Pearson r=0.382）。

Conclusion: 无监督指标（包括基于LLM的方法）可实现可扩展筛选，但由于中等相关性和低一致性系数，在高风险法律环境中不能完全替代人工判断。这项工作通过提供无需标注的评估工具推进了法律NLP发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)能够生成高度逼真的垃圾评论，对现有检测系统构成严重威胁，危及在线平台的可信度。

Method: FraudSquad混合检测模型，结合预训练语言模型的文本嵌入和图门控变换器进行垃圾节点分类，无需手动特征工程或大量训练资源。

Conclusion: 研究贡献包括新的合成数据集、实用检测框架和实证证据，强调需要适应LLM时代的垃圾检测需求。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在数学问题上存在语法盲点，即使语义简单但表达方式陌生时也会出错。通过从正确示例中提取语法模板重新表述问题，可以显著提高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs在数学推理中存在系统性失败模式——语法盲点，即模型会将熟悉的推理策略错误应用于语义简单但表达方式陌生的问题，这反映了表面形式与内部表征之间的脆弱耦合。

Method: 使用从正确示例中提取的语法模板重新表述错误回答的问题，保持语义不变但降低结构复杂度。采用基于依存局部性理论(DLT)的指标量化语法复杂度。

Result: 重新表述后的问题往往能得到正确答案。更高的DLT分数与多个数据集中的失败率增加相关，表明语法复杂度是导致错误的重要因素。

Conclusion: 许多推理错误源于结构不对齐而非概念困难，语法感知的干预可以揭示和缓解这些归纳失败。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网页中的半结构化内容（HTML表格、列表、信息框）包含大量事实数据，但现有方法要么缺乏泛化能力，要么因每页LLM推理而资源密集，难以可靠提取结构化信息。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，利用网站内网页布局相似性作为奖励信号，生成可重用的提取脚本，并在CommonCrawl数据上通过合成注释进行迭代训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在脚本质量上比强基线高出13%以上，并将GPT-4o的下游问答准确率提高了4%以上。

Conclusion: SCRIBES实现了可扩展且资源高效的网页信息提取，解决了现有方法在泛化性和资源消耗方面的挑战。

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

Result: 多模态模型在BabyLM基准测试中表现优于之前的基线模型，但在专注于语法的纯语言基准测试中表现不佳。模型融合方法在一定程度上缓解了这个问题，同时保持了多模态性能。

Conclusion: 模型融合方法能够有效缓解多模态模型在纯语言任务中的性能下降问题，为在低资源设置下开发更平衡的多模态模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

Result: 实验显示REPAIR在多个模型系列中将编辑准确率提高了10%-30%，并显著减少了知识遗忘。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发可靠、可扩展且持续演进的LLM提供了一个稳健框架。

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning
performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune
LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from
multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM

Motivation: 当前LLMs的防御机制分散且不成熟，需要统一的框架来提升对抗鲁棒性和安全性。

Method: 提出逆向语言建模(ILM)框架，同时提升LLMs对输入扰动的鲁棒性，并通过反转模型输出识别有害输入触发器。

Result: ILM将LLMs从静态生成器转变为可分析和鲁棒的系统，有助于红队测试，为下一代更可控可信的LLMs奠定基础。

Conclusion: ILM为构建更鲁棒、可落地、可控和可信赖的下一代LLMs提供了基础框架。

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有的声明验证方法主要依赖提示工程或预设推理流程，缺乏统一的训练范式来提升必要的验证技能，无法准确反映真实世界的验证场景。

Method: 采用在线强化学习框架，让LLM与搜索引擎动态交互，通过奖励信号明确塑造其规划、检索和推理行为。

Conclusion: 在线强化学习对于精确和忠实的声明验证是有效的，为未来研究提供了基础，并发布了代码以支持社区在LLM赋能声明验证方面的进展。

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and

*Adina Nicola Dobrinoiu,Ana Cristiana Marcu,Amir Homayounirad,Luciano Cavalcante Siebert,Enrico Liscio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索语言模型能否通过多维主观标注来预测个体价值解释，发现同时提供SEAT四个维度能显著提升预测性能，强调考虑个体主观标注差异的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 价值概念的解释受社会文化背景和生活经历影响而具有主观性，需要开发能够与多样化人类视角对齐的AI系统，避免偏向多数观点。

Method: 使用SEAT维度作为个体解释视角的代理，评估在零样本和少样本设置下，提供个体在情感、情绪、论证和主题方面的标注示例是否能帮助语言模型预测其价值解释。

Result: 实验表明同时提供所有SEAT维度比单独维度或基线表现更优，个体标注者之间的差异凸显了考虑个体主观标注的重要性。

Conclusion: 这是首个超越人口统计特征、研究标注行为对价值预测影响的受控实验，为未来大规模验证提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

### [72] [Exploring Database Normalization Effects on SQL Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01989)
*Ryosuke Kohita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了数据库模式规范化对NL2SQL系统性能的影响，发现非规范化模式在简单检索查询中表现更好，而规范化模式在聚合查询中更具优势，最佳模式设计取决于查询类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多在固定模式上评估NL2SQL模型，忽视了模式设计对性能的影响。本文旨在系统研究模式规范化程度如何影响NL2SQL系统的表现。

Method: 评估8个领先大语言模型，使用包含不同规范化级别（1NF-3NF）的合成数据集和真实学术论文数据集，在零样本和少样本设置下进行测试。

Result: 非规范化模式在简单检索查询中准确率高，即使使用成本效益高的零样本模型；规范化模式在聚合查询中表现更好，能有效避免数据重复和NULL值问题；少样本示例能显著改善规范化模式中的表选择和连接预测错误。

Conclusion: NL2SQL应用的最佳模式设计取决于支持的查询类型，开发时应考虑模式设计因素并集成自适应模式选择机制。

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，并通过系统实验比较了传统基线模型、单语预训练模型和LLM在低资源环境下的表现，发现LoRA调优的LLM与BanglaBERT竞争力相当，但文化语言相关的预训练对鲁棒性能仍至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社交媒体平台是日常沟通和信息获取的核心，但也为仇恨言论、冒犯性语言和欺凌内容的传播提供了温床。这些内容破坏在线安全、参与和公平性。需要可靠的检测系统，特别是在低资源语言中，现有的孟加拉语研究多为单任务模型，缺乏多维度信号（类型、严重程度、目标）的覆盖。

Method: 构建首个多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，这是迄今为止最大的人工标注语料库之一。在此基础上进行全面的受控比较，涵盖经典基线模型、单语预训练模型和LLM，在零样本提示和LoRA微调下评估LLM在低资源环境中的适应性。

Result: 实验揭示了持续趋势：尽管LoRA调优的LLM与BanglaBERT竞争力相当，但文化和语言相关的预训练对于鲁棒性能仍然至关重要。

Conclusion: 本文的数据集和发现为在低资源环境中开发文化对齐的审核工具建立了更强的基准。为确保可复现性，将发布数据集和相关脚本。

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

TL;DR: 该研究从过程导向角度评估大语言模型的创造力，通过约束决策框架分析其作为计算作者的创作偏好，发现模型普遍更重视风格而非其他叙事元素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估主要关注输出质量而非创作过程，本研究旨在通过叙事学视角分析LLMs作为计算作者的创作过程。

Method: 使用基于约束的决策框架，通过受控提示分配作者角色，分析模型的创作偏好，并探究其选择背后的推理过程。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在所有模型中一致地更强调风格元素，而非角色、事件和场景等其他叙事要素，不同模型呈现出独特的创作偏好特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统分析AI作者创造力提供了新工具，揭示了LLMs在叙事创作中的特定偏好模式。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

TL;DR: 提出了Streaming RAG框架，通过在用户说话时并行预测工具查询来降低端到端语音对话系统的延迟，提高事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音对话系统虽然能生成更自然、低延迟的响应，但容易产生幻觉，缺乏事实基础。需要将工具使用扩展到语音系统中，但工具集成会增加响应延迟。

Method: 开发了Streaming RAG框架，包括后训练流程，教导模型在用户说话过程中何时发出工具调用，以及如何生成融合音频查询和检索文本结果的语音摘要。

Result: 在AudioCRAG基准测试中，QA准确率相对提升200%（从11.1%提升到34.2%），工具使用延迟降低20%。

Conclusion: Streaming RAG方法不仅提高了准确性和响应性，而且是模态无关的，可应用于文本输入，为更自主的实时AI助手铺平道路。

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SCoT框架，一种用于双工口语对话系统的流式思维链方法，通过分块处理用户输入和生成响应，解决了传统VAD无法区分停顿和对话结束的问题，同时避免了复杂双通道架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端口语对话系统依赖语音活动检测(VAD)进行话轮转换，但VAD无法区分停顿和对话完成。现有双工系统虽然解决了这个问题，但架构复杂且在语义推理上落后于级联模型。

Method: 提出了流式思维链(SCoT)框架，交替处理固定时长的用户输入并以分块方式生成响应。使用帧级对齐为每个块创建中间目标——对齐的用户转录和系统响应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比现有双工方法产生更连贯和可解释的响应，同时相比逐轮系统支持更低延迟和重叠交互。

Conclusion: SCoT框架成功解决了双工口语对话系统中的架构复杂性和语义推理不足问题，实现了更自然流畅的人机对话交互。

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码技术已成为系统减少大语言模型解码时间的标准方法，但研究发现其加速效果在不同任务间分布不均，特别是对欠拟合和代表性不足任务的加速效果较差，这引发了公平性担忧。

Method: 通过理论分析量化推测解码中的不公平现象，识别导致加速差异的因素，并基于这些洞察提出了一种缓解策略来减少速度差异。

Result: 验证了推测解码在不同任务间存在显著的加速差异，提出的缓解策略在多个模型对中平均改善了公平性指标12%。

Conclusion: 推测解码技术存在任务间加速不公平的问题，通过针对性缓解策略可以有效减少这种差异，提高技术应用的公平性。

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

TL;DR: RESTRAIN是一种自约束强化学习框架，通过自我惩罚机制利用无标签数据进行推理模型训练，在多个推理基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统使用人工标注数据的强化学习方法成本高昂且在困难任务上表现不佳，需要一种能够利用无标签数据进行持续自我改进的方法。

Method: RESTRAIN框架通过自我惩罚机制，利用模型的整个答案分布信号：惩罚过度自信的推理路径和低一致性示例，同时保留有希望的推理链，可无缝集成到GRPO等策略优化方法中。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Base和OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base模型上，RESTRAIN在AIME25上提升Pass@1达+140.7%，在MMLU_STEM上提升+36.2%，在GPQA-Diamond上提升+19.6%，几乎达到使用黄金标签训练的效果。

Conclusion: RESTRAIN为无需黄金标签实现更强推理能力提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

TL;DR: 提出RL4HS强化学习框架，通过span-level奖励函数激励推理过程，用于检测大语言模型生成的幻觉内容，在RAGTruth基准测试中优于预训练推理模型和监督微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多将幻觉检测视为二元分类任务，但实际应用需要识别幻觉的具体范围，这是一个多步骤决策过程。研究明确推理是否有助于检测幻觉范围。

Method: 首先评估带和不带思维链推理的预训练模型，发现CoT推理有潜力生成正确答案。然后提出RL4HS强化学习框架，基于Group Relative Policy Optimization并引入Class-Aware Policy Optimization来解决奖励不平衡问题。

Result: 在RAGTruth基准测试（摘要、问答、数据到文本）上，RL4HS超越了预训练推理模型和监督微调方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，使用span-level奖励的强化学习对于检测幻觉范围是必要的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低知识图谱交互的门槛，使非计算机背景用户能够通过自然语言查询知识图谱，解决SPARQL查询语言的高学习成本问题。

Method: 基于SPINACH的LLM代理架构，采用迭代探索执行过程进行自然语言到SPARQL的转换，而非单次翻译。

Result: 开发了能够通过迭代过程将自然语言问题转换为SPARQL查询的代理系统，并对其行为进行了深入分析。

Conclusion: 该方法为Text2SPARQL领域提供了改进方向，通过迭代探索执行过程提高了自然语言到SPARQL查询转换的效果。

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

Conclusion: 该框架为开发更可信的移动智能体提供了具体诊断工具，揭示了当前模型中的系统性推理-执行差距模式。

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖自我探索或单一教师模型来引导长链推理，这可能导致内在模型偏差并限制探索，最终影响推理多样性和性能。

Method: 提出自适应多指导策略优化(AMPO)，仅在策略模型无法生成正确解时自适应地利用多个熟练教师模型的指导，并采用基于理解的筛选机制让学生学习最可能理解的推理路径。

Result: AMPO在数学推理任务上比强基线(GRPO)提升4.3%，在分布外任务上提升12.2%，显著提高了Pass@k性能并实现了更多样化的探索。

Conclusion: AMPO展示了实现更优推理和泛化能力的更高效、可扩展路径，使用四个同等规模教师模型即可达到与使用单一更强大教师模型方法相当的结果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X
(formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional
well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language
content. We assembled a dataset of 10,662 X posts, pre-processed the data, and
used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We
conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for
automatically detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying. We first tested a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model and a bidirectional long short-term memory
(Bi-LSTM) model with several experimental word embeddings. We also tested the
LSTM and Bi-LSTM models with a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder from
representations (BERT) and then tested them on a different experimental models
BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM
with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As

*Tianyi Jiang,Yi Bin,Yujuan Ding,Kainian Zhu,Fei Ma,Jingkuan Song,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TECA指标和CER机制来解决LLMs在简单问题上过度思考的问题，实现"探索后决策"的推理范式，显著减少响应长度而不影响解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂问题上表现出色，但在简单问题上会产生不必要的冗长推理步骤，导致效率低下且难以根据问题复杂度调整推理深度。

Method: 引入Token熵累积平均(TECA)指标来衡量推理过程中的探索程度，提出累积熵调节(CER)机制，让模型动态确定结束思考的最佳时机。

Result: 在多种数学基准测试中，该方法显著减轻了过度思考问题，在简单数据集上平均响应长度减少高达71%，同时保持问题解决能力。

Conclusion: 提出的"探索后决策"推理范式通过TECA和CER机制实现了更高效和自适应的推理过程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

*Yaxin Du,Yuanshuo Zhang,Xiyuan Yang,Yifan Zhou,Cheng Wang,Gongyi Zou,Xianghe Pang,Wenhao Wang,Menglan Chen,Shuo Tang,Zhiyu Li,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了InfoMosaic-Bench基准测试，用于评估工具增强型智能体在多源信息检索中的表现，发现当前LLM智能体在结合通用搜索和领域专用工具方面存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体过度依赖开放网络搜索，面临内容噪声和可靠性问题，且无法获取精确的领域专业知识。虽然MCP协议允许智能体访问数千种专用工具，但智能体是否能有效利用这些工具并与通用搜索结合仍不明确。

Method: 构建InfoMosaic-Bench基准测试，涵盖六个代表性领域，要求智能体结合通用搜索和领域专用工具。使用InfoMosaic-Flow流程合成任务，确保任务条件基于已验证工具输出，强制执行跨源依赖，并过滤可通过简单查找解决的捷径案例。

Result: 对14个最先进LLM智能体的实验显示：仅使用网络信息时GPT-5准确率仅38.2%，通过率67.5%；领域工具提供选择性但不一致的收益；22.4%的失败源于工具使用或选择错误。

Conclusion: 当前LLM智能体在多源信息检索任务中表现不佳，特别是在工具使用方面存在显著困难，需要进一步改进智能体的工具集成能力。

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了英语强化后训练（RPT）获得的大推理模型（LRMs）的推理能力是否能有效迁移到其他语言，发现跨语言可迁移性因模型、目标语言和训练范式而异，并提出了平行训练方法显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注RL推理在任务或模态间的泛化，而本文从跨语言角度探讨推理泛化，检验英语RPT获得的推理能力是否能迁移到其他语言。

Method: 系统评估英语中心LRMs在多语言推理基准上的表现，引入量化跨语言可迁移性的指标，进行干预研究和平行训练实验。

Result: 发现跨语言可迁移性差异显著，强英语能力模型过度依赖英语特定模式导致泛化减弱；平行训练带来性能跃升，跨语言推理迁移遵循幂律规律，存在单语泛化差距。

Conclusion: 挑战了LRM推理模仿人类认知的假设，为开发更语言无关的LRMs提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

Abstract: We introduce VLM-Lens, a toolkit designed to enable systematic benchmarking,
analysis, and interpretation of vision-language models (VLMs) by supporting the
extraction of intermediate outputs from any layer during the forward pass of
open-source VLMs. VLM-Lens provides a unified, YAML-configurable interface that
abstracts away model-specific complexities and supports user-friendly operation
across diverse VLMs. It currently supports 16 state-of-the-art base VLMs and
their over 30 variants, and is extensible to accommodate new models without
changing the core logic.
  The toolkit integrates easily with various interpretability and analysis
methods. We demonstrate its usage with two simple analytical experiments,
revealing systematic differences in the hidden representations of VLMs across
layers and target concepts. VLM-Lens is released as an open-sourced project to

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文质疑当前LLM竞技场评估中将平局视为模型实力相等的做法，提出平局更多反映查询难度而非模型能力相当，并建议在评分更新中考虑查询属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM竞技场评估使用Elo评分系统，将平局视为两个模型实力相等而调整评分。作者质疑这种假设，认为平局更可能反映查询难度而非模型能力相当。

Method: 在三个真实世界竞技场数据集上，研究忽略平局评分更新对战斗结果预测准确性的影响，并分析平局与查询难度、客观性的关系。

Result: 忽略平局评分更新使四种评分系统的战斗结果预测准确率相对提高1-3%。平局更常出现在非常容易和高度客观的查询中，风险比分别为1.37和1.35。

Conclusion: 建议未来评分系统重新考虑平局的语义，并在评分更新中考虑查询属性，而不是简单地将平局视为模型实力相等。

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在运筹学任务中依赖闭源API带来的隐私问题，以及从头训练开源模型的高计算成本问题。

Method: 使用半自动数据合成流程生成多样化的运筹学问题-答案对，通过微调Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct模型，并增强模型调用外部求解器API的能力。

Result: 在四个标准基准测试中的三个上达到80.1%执行准确率，比同等规模基线模型提高4.3%以上；在两种未见过的运筹学问题类型的零样本评估中，平均准确率达到54%，比最强基线提高21个百分点。

Conclusion: 验证了工具增强的微调方法在准确且可泛化的运筹学问题建模和求解中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but
reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and
training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We
introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a
semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer
pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On
three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution
accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot
evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a
21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline. These findings
validate the efficacy of tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs for accurate and
generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类行为建模方法要么对理性做出不切实际的假设，要么计算量过大难以快速适应，需要更高效准确的行为预测方法支持人机协作。

Method: 将日常社交互动视为可预测的"脚本"，建模为行为程序。使用LLM合成行为程序假设空间，结合概率推理处理不确定性。

Result: 在网格世界任务和家庭模拟器中测试，ROTE从稀疏观测预测人类和AI行为，比行为克隆和LLM方法准确率高出50%，在样本内和样本外泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 将动作理解视为程序合成问题，为AI系统在现实世界中高效预测人类行为开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

Result: 知识库增强机制使7个专家智能体的对话质量评分平均提高10-15%；协作智能体的干预使远域专家对的协作效率提升8.5%，而近域对仅提升0.8%，揭示了"知识库差距导致的协作效率递减"效应。

Conclusion: 精心设计的多智能体架构为化学工程领域的自主科学发现提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估基准无法捕捉LLM作为自主智能体在交互环境中涌现的社会和认知动态，需要新的评估方法来理解智能体的社会行为。

Method: 使用多智能体辩论作为"社会实验室"，让具有不同角色和激励的LLM智能体在LLM主持人的监督下就各种话题进行辩论，采用新的心理测量和语义指标进行分析。

Result: 发现智能体具有强烈的共识寻求倾向（语义一致度μ>0.88），角色分配能产生稳定的心理测量特征，主持人的角色能显著改变辩论结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为面向智能体场景的动态、基于心理测量的评估协议提供了蓝图，为理解和塑造下一代AI智能体的社会行为提供了关键方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在多模态理解和推理方面虽有进步，但在基本感知和推理能力上仍有限制，特别是在简单拼图任务上表现接近随机。高质量视觉语言数据的稀缺性和有限可扩展性限制了模型能力的提升。

Method: 提出AGILE方法，将拼图解决构建为交互过程，模型基于当前状态生成可执行代码执行动作，环境提供细粒度视觉反馈。通过观察和交互的迭代循环，模型通过探索和反馈逐步提升感知和推理能力。

Conclusion: AGILE为推进多模态模型的推理和泛化能力开辟了新途径，为多模态强化学习数据稀缺问题提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational

provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

*Leon Garza,Anantaa Kotal,Michael A. Grasso,Emre Umucu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的临床决策支持系统，通过分析电子健康记录为处方医生提供治疗建议，采用检索增强生成技术整合结构化和非结构化数据，初步评估显示在适当约束下具有临床应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策复杂性增加和电子健康记录快速增长带来了数据驱动护理的机遇与挑战，需要辅助工具来支持处方决策。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)管道，整合自然语言处理和结构化临床输入，通过分析患者人口统计、症状、诊断和治疗历史等数据生成治疗建议。

Result: 初步评估使用去标识化和合成临床数据集，结果显示模型输出具有临床合理性和一致性，在适当约束下可为处方工作流提供有价值的决策支持。

Conclusion: 这是将生成式AI整合到现实世界临床决策中的初步尝试，强调透明度、安全性以及与既定实践的协调性。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

*Xinpeng Wang,Nitish Joshi,Barbara Plank,Rico Angell,He He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TRACE方法，通过截断推理链来检测隐式奖励破解行为，在数学推理和编程任务中显著优于现有CoT监控方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励破解行为（模型利用奖励函数漏洞获得高分但不解决实际任务）是一个严重威胁，特别是隐式破解，其推理链看似正常从而绕过现有监控方法。

Method: TRACE方法通过逐步截断模型的推理链，强制模型在不同长度下回答，测量验证器通过率。利用曲线下面积量化模型是否走捷径。

Result: 在数学推理任务中比最强的72B CoT监控器提升超过65%，在编程任务中比32B监控器提升超过30%。还能在训练中发现未知漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE为当前监控方法失效的监督场景提供了一种可扩展的无监督解决方案。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

*Humaid Ibrahim,Nikolai Rozanov,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种通过蒸馏将推理时检索转化为学习能力的方法，用失败案例生成紧凑提示，创建改进的教师轨迹，训练学生模型内部化知识，在多个基准测试中显著提升性能并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在多步任务中经常出现可预测的失败，如尝试不满足前提条件的动作、发出冗余命令或错误处理环境约束。虽然RAG可以通过运行时指导提高性能，但需要维护外部知识库并在每次部署时增加计算开销。

Method: 1) 从代理失败中提取紧凑、可重用的提示；2) 使用这些提示在回合开始时通过一次性检索生成改进的教师轨迹；3) 在移除提示字符串的情况下训练学生模型，强制内部化而非记忆。

Result: 在ALFWorld（家务任务）和WebShop（在线购物）两个交互基准测试中，蒸馏后的学生模型始终优于基线代理，ALFWorld成功率高达91%（基线为79%），WebShop得分提升至72（基线为61），同时比检索增强的教师模型少用10-60%的token。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模（7B/14B参数）和代理架构（ReAct/StateAct）上都能泛化，表明检索的好处可以通过有针对性的微调有效内部化，而无需永久的运行时依赖。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工程依赖大量实验和模拟数据集，传统数据驱动方法需要大量人工干预，限制了扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 评估两种LLM代理框架：多代理系统和基于ReAct范式的单代理系统，自动处理数据预处理、神经网络开发、训练、超参数优化和不确定性量化。

Result: LLM代理开发的模型超越了传统临界热通量查找表，预测精度和不确定性量化与人类专家开发的最先进贝叶斯优化深度神经网络模型相当。

Conclusion: LLM代理在自动化复杂工程建模任务方面具有巨大潜力，能显著减少人工工作量，同时达到或超越现有预测性能标准。

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntoLogX是一个基于大语言模型的自主AI代理，能将原始日志转换为基于本体的知识图谱，并通过RAG和迭代校正确保图谱质量，最终映射到MITRE ATT&CK战术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统日志是重要的网络威胁情报来源，但由于缺乏结构化、语义不一致和跨设备碎片化，其效用受限。需要将噪声异构数据转换为连贯可互操作的表示。

Method: 集成轻量级日志本体与检索增强生成(RAG)和迭代校正步骤，确保生成的知识图谱语法和语义有效。聚合图谱到会话级别，使用LLM预测MITRE ATT&CK战术。

Result: 在公共基准和真实世界蜜罐数据集上评估，展示了跨多个KG后端的稳健图谱生成，以及将对抗活动准确映射到ATT&CK战术的能力。检索和校正提高了精确率和召回率。

Conclusion: 基于本体的表示为可操作的CTI提取提供了价值，代码导向模型在结构化日志分析中有效，检索和校正对精度和召回率有益。

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

TL;DR: Falconer是一个结合LLM智能推理和轻量级代理模型的可扩展知识挖掘框架，能在保持高准确率的同时大幅降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在大规模知识挖掘中部署成本过高，而传统分类器和提取器管道虽然高效但脆弱且无法泛化到新任务的问题。

Method: 使用LLM作为规划器分解用户指令为可执行管道，并作为标注器生成监督数据训练小型代理模型，将分类和提取统一为两个原子操作。

Result: Falconer在指令遵循准确性上接近最先进的LLM，同时推理成本降低90%，大规模知识挖掘速度提升20倍以上。

Conclusion: Falconer为深度研究提供了一个高效且可扩展的基础框架，实现了LLM推理能力与轻量级模型效率的平衡。

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

Motivation: AI教育社区常常忽视领域专家提供的高度策划知识在创建有效辅导系统中的作用，本文旨在强调这一主题的重要性。

Method: 1. 使用可解释AI技术结合专家指定的解题规则自动生成课程；2. 利用专家制定的学习目标概念课程大纲开发自适应辅导系统。

Result: 通过传粉者识别辅导系统的案例研究，证明了这些方法的重要性，表明此类知识可以轻松从专家那里获取。

Conclusion: 高度策划的专家知识在创建有效的AI教育系统中具有重要作用，特别是在自动生成课程和开发自适应辅导系统方面。

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

TL;DR: VOGUE通过将探索从输出空间转移到输入空间，利用视觉不确定性指导多模态大语言模型的强化学习，显著提升了推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在处理多模态输入时，将视觉输入视为固定条件，忽略了视觉变化带来的不确定性，导致策略不够鲁棒。

Method: VOGUE将图像视为随机上下文，通过对称KL散度量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，结合不确定性比例奖励、token熵奖励和退火采样来平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在三个视觉数学基准上平均提升2.6%的pass@1准确率，在三个通用领域推理基准上提升3.7%，同时提高了pass@4性能并缓解了探索衰减问题。

Conclusion: 基于视觉输入固有不确定性的探索策略是提升多模态推理的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了AIReg-Bench基准数据集，用于评估大型语言模型在判断AI系统是否符合欧盟AI法案方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着政府对AI的监管加强，需要评估LLM在AI法规合规性判断方面的性能，但目前缺乏相应的基准测试方法。

Method: 通过两步法创建数据集：1）使用精心设计的提示词让LLM生成120个技术文档片段；2）法律专家审查并标注每个样本是否违反AI法案的具体条款。

Result: 创建了首个专门用于测试LLM评估AI法案合规性的基准数据集，并对前沿LLM进行了初步评估。

Conclusion: 该基准为理解LLM在AI法规合规评估中的机会和局限性提供了起点，并为后续LLM的比较建立了基准。

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts (LToT) 是一种改进的搜索控制器，通过分离效用和逻辑一致性，将低效用但一致的候选视为资产而非浪费，解决了标准树搜索中的广度饱和和深度近视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代部署中大量测试时计算资源被用于提升可靠性，但标准树搜索方法存在两个问题：广度饱和（额外样本产生近似重复）和深度近视（噪声短期效用剪枝了长期回报的分支）。

Method: LToT将前沿分为主线（高效用候选用于开发）和侧线（一致但初始低效用候选），通过侧向竞赛与短路机制（LR--SC）进行探索，使用有上限的连续减半竞赛和宽度感知阈值。

Result: 理论证明侧向成本为伪线性Θ(N₀ log_η N₀)，与无上限主线的指数增长形成对比。实证评估正在进行中。

Conclusion: LToT将大量测试时预算转化为原则性多样性，同时保持提升纪律，缓解饱和和近视问题而不增加计算成本。

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

Motivation: 为了分析大型语言模型在数学推理任务中的内部表示，并指导生成过程实现利用和探索的平衡，避免极端行为。

Method: 训练稀疏自编码器生成稀疏向量表示，应用k-means聚类构建token转移图，基于边权重定义奖励函数量化推理轨迹的遵循程度。

Result: 研究发现平衡利用和探索对数学推理任务的高准确性至关重要，稀疏自编码器可作为可扩展的奖励模型指导生成。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效平衡利用和探索，防止极端行为，促进LLM中更高质量的推理过程。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域如法律和医学中，需要准确、可验证且明确基于证据的推理。LLM在标准推理任务中表现出色，但在处理包含大量例外和可废止规则的高保证文本时面临挑战。

Method: 提出LogT神经符号架构，使用高级逻辑语言和推理器与LLM结合，构建双重符号图上下文和基于逻辑的上下文，将长文本指南的推理问题转化为紧凑的接地评估。

Conclusion: LogT架构通过结合符号逻辑和神经方法，有效解决了高保证文本推理中的挑战，特别是在处理否定、蕴含和可废止规则方面表现出显著优势。

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

TL;DR: InfoSeeker是一个LLM决策框架，通过将任务导向规划与信息寻求相结合，在部分可观测环境中处理观察和环境动态的不确定性，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规划智能体虽然解决了观测不确定性，但往往忽略了其内部动态与实际环境之间的差异，需要主动寻求信息来对齐内部动态。

Method: 提出InfoSeeker框架，提示LLM通过规划行动来主动收集信息，验证理解、检测环境变化或测试假设，然后生成或修订任务导向计划。

Result: 在部分可观测环境基准测试中，InfoSeeker相比先前方法实现了74%的绝对性能提升，且不牺牲样本效率，在机器人操作和网页导航等基准测试中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 在部分可观测环境中，紧密集成规划和信息寻求对于实现鲁棒行为至关重要，InfoSeeker框架有效解决了内部动态与环境不匹配的问题。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

TL;DR: 提出SAPO算法，通过过程奖励函数改进扩散语言模型的推理能力，解决现有方法中推理路径不结构化的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖稀疏结果奖励，会强化导致偶然正确结果的错误推理路径，与推理的自然结构不匹配

Method: 提出理论框架将复杂问题解决形式化为层次选择过程，并基于此设计SAPO算法，使用过程奖励函数引导模型学习结构化推理路径

Result: 在挑战性推理基准测试中显著提升性能，并增强生成过程的可解释性

Conclusion: SAPO通过将去噪过程与潜在推理层次对齐，有效改进了扩散语言模型的复杂推理能力

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InvThink是一种让大语言模型具备逆向思维能力的方法，通过预先考虑失败模式来生成更安全的响应，在安全性和通用推理能力方面都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法直接优化安全响应，但缺乏对潜在风险的系统性考虑。InvThink旨在让模型在生成响应前主动分析可能的危害和后果。

Method: 1) 列举潜在危害 2) 分析后果 3) 生成主动避免这些风险的安全输出。通过监督微调和强化学习在三个LLM系列中实现。

Result: 安全改进随模型规模扩展效果更强；减轻安全税，保持标准基准上的通用推理能力；在高风险领域（医疗、金融、法律等）有害响应减少达15.7%。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为构建更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了可扩展和通用的路径。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

TL;DR: AdvEvo-MARL是一个协同进化的多智能体强化学习框架，通过内部化安全机制来保护LLM多智能体系统免受越狱、提示注入和对抗性协作攻击，无需依赖外部防护模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM多智能体系统防御方法存在不足：自我验证方法因单个智能体缺乏检测跨智能体不安全链的能力而效果不佳；外部防护模块会增加系统开销并造成单点故障。

Method: 提出AdvEvo-MARL框架，通过对抗学习环境联合优化攻击者（合成进化越狱提示）和防御者（训练任务智能体既能完成任务又能抵抗攻击），并引入公共基线进行优势估计以稳定学习和促进合作。

Result: 在代表性攻击场景中，AdvEvo-MARL将攻击成功率保持在20%以下，而基线方法可达38.33%，同时保持甚至提高任务准确性（在推理任务上提升达+3.67%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，无需依赖额外防护智能体或增加系统开销，就能同时提高安全性和实用性。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

Motivation: 现有交互式对话推荐系统在处理动态用户偏好、保持对话连贯性和平衡多个排序目标方面面临重大挑战。

Method: 采用分层智能体网络，包含对话理解、偏好建模、上下文感知和动态排序等专门LLM智能体，通过自适应权重机制协调，结合三层学习策略。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，AgentRec在对话成功率提升2.8%，推荐准确率(NDCG@10)提高1.9%，对话效率提升3.2%，同时保持可比较的计算成本。

Conclusion: AgentRec通过多智能体协作和自适应机制有效解决了现有对话推荐系统的关键挑战，在多个指标上实现了显著改进。

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative
recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical
agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized
LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context
awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting
mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent
coordination.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在需要认知能力的应用（如心理咨询）中的潜力，评估LLMs是否具备担任心理咨询师所需的知识资质。

Method: 开发PsychoBench基准测试，包含约2,252个精心设计的单选题，基于美国国家心理咨询师认证考试，涵盖心理学各子学科，要求深度理解。

Result: GPT-4o、Llama3.3-70B和Gemma3-27B等先进模型得分远超及格线（约70%），而较小的开源模型（如Qwen2.5-7B、Mistral-7B）远低于及格标准。

Conclusion: 只有前沿大型语言模型目前能够满足心理咨询考试标准，这突显了开发心理学导向LLMs的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CMDP方法在高维或非结构化上下文环境中泛化能力差，导致计算开销大、性能不稳定，需要一种可扩展的上下文压缩方法。

Method: 基于信息论的摘要方法，利用LLM将上下文输入压缩为低维语义摘要，保留决策关键信息并减少冗余，构建近似上下文充分性框架。

Result: 在离散、连续、视觉和推荐基准测试中，该方法优于原始上下文和非上下文基线，提高了奖励、成功率、样本效率，同时降低了延迟和内存使用。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的摘要为上下文丰富、资源受限环境中的高效决策提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

Method: 将轨迹恢复作为代理任务，构建GLOBALTRACE数据集（包含4000+真实轨迹），使用道路网络作为上下文，通过提示框架让LLMs生成有效路径。

Result: LLMs在轨迹恢复任务中表现优于现有基线方法和专门模型，具备零样本泛化能力，但存在区域和交通模式的系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLMs具备强大的道路网络和坐标系理解能力，能够通过灵活的地图推理来增强导航体验，满足用户偏好。

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

Motivation: 计算机使用代理在GUI上执行操作以实现用户目标，但研究发现这些代理普遍存在盲目追求目标的问题，可能导致安全风险和不可靠行为。

Method: 开发了BLIND-ACT基准，包含90个任务，基于OSWorld提供真实环境，使用LLM评估代理行为，评估了9个前沿模型。

Result: 在评估的9个模型中观察到平均80.8%的BGD率，即使输入无害也会出现风险。提示干预可降低BGD水平但风险仍然存在。

Conclusion: 识别BGD并引入BLIND-ACT为未来研究和减轻这种基本风险奠定了基础，确保CUA的安全部署。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

Motivation: 当前AGI评估方法主要依赖对智能的直觉理解来设计合成任务，但这些方法在AI历史上表现不佳，需要更有效的评估哲学。

Method: 提出基于稳健任务执行的评估设计哲学，借鉴数据科学中展示系统可靠部署的实践方法，提供具体的AGI评估实例。

Result: 论证了传统基于直觉的AGI评估方法的局限性，提出了更实用的基于能力展示的替代方案。

Conclusion: AGI评估应转向关注系统在实际任务中的稳健执行能力，而非依赖直觉设计的合成测试，这能更好地指示向AGI的进展。

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

Motivation: 现有偏好微调方法忽略了合成偏好标注中普遍存在的风格和长度偏差噪声问题，需要更有效的负样本生成策略来提升模型对齐效果。

Method: 基于LLM引导的响应编辑框架，生成具有针对性错误的拒绝响应，保持与接受响应在风格和长度上的相似性，构建了包含30K高质量样本的VaPR数据集。

Result: 在三个LVLM家族上微调后，在十个基准测试中取得显著性能提升：LLaVA平均提升6.5%，Qwen2VL提升4.0%，Qwen2.5VL提升1.5%，特别是在推理任务上表现突出。

Conclusion: VaPR框架有效解决了合成偏好标注中的偏差问题，显著提升模型性能，且该框架可泛化到开源LLM作为编辑器，性能接近使用GPT-4o合成的版本。

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their

its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is

Method: 通过将NIST CSF 2.0功能细分为具体任务，将AI智能体属性（自主性、自适应学习、实时响应）与安全需求关联，并定义渐进式自主级别。

Result: 框架展示了定制化AI智能体部署如何与现实约束和风险状况对齐，增强态势感知、加速响应时间，并通过自适应风险管理强化长期韧性。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于行业标准的稳健、经验验证的多智能体系统奠定了基础，实现了理论AI构建与运营网络安全需求的桥梁作用。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, structured decision support framework that
systematically aligns diverse artificial intelligence (AI) agent architectures,
reactive, cognitive, hybrid, and learning, with the comprehensive National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
By integrating agent theory with industry guidelines, this framework provides a
transparent and stepwise methodology for selecting and deploying AI solutions
to address contemporary cyber threats. Employing a granular decomposition of
NIST CSF 2.0 functions into specific tasks, the study links essential AI agent
properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,
incident response, and governance strategy. Through conceptual validation, the
framework demonstrates how tailored AI agent deployments can align with
real-world constraints and risk profiles, enhancing situational awareness,
accelerating response times, and fortifying long-term resilience via adaptive
risk management. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical
AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation
for robust, empirically validated multi-agent systems that adhere to industry
standards.

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PTA-GRPO框架，通过两阶段方法改进LLM的推理能力：第一阶段使用高级LLM将思维链提炼为紧凑的高层指导进行监督微调；第二阶段引入指导感知的强化学习方法联合优化最终输出和指导质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂推理任务中主要依赖思维链推理，但由于自回归的token级生成，推理过程局限于局部决策而缺乏全局规划，导致冗余、不连贯或不准确的推理，严重影响性能。现有方法如树基算法和强化学习存在高计算成本且难以产生最优推理轨迹的问题。

Method: PTA-GRPO两阶段框架：1) 使用高级LLM将思维链提炼为紧凑高层指导，进行监督微调；2) 引入指导感知的强化学习方法，联合优化最终输出和指导质量。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试（MATH、AIME2024、AIME2025、AMC）和不同基础模型（Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct、Qwen3-8B、Qwen3-14B、LLaMA3.2-3B）上的实验表明，PTA-GRPO在不同模型和任务上均实现了稳定且显著的改进。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO框架有效提升了LLM的推理能力，验证了其有效性和泛化性，通过结合高层规划和细粒度推理优化，解决了现有方法在全局规划和计算效率方面的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种对抗性逆强化学习方法，为大型语言模型学习密集的令牌级推理奖励模型，用于过程监督而非风格模仿。该奖励模型在训练时提供步骤级反馈优化推理策略，在推理时作为批评器对采样轨迹进行重排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过监督微调模仿专家风格，但本文旨在学习能够优先考虑正确性而非表面形式的推理奖励，使奖励与最终答案有效性相关，并能定位推理过程中的错误。

Method: 采用对抗性逆强化学习框架，从专家演示中学习密集的令牌级推理奖励模型。该模型在训练时提供步骤级反馈优化推理策略，在推理时作为批评器对采样轨迹进行重排序。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上使用Llama3和Qwen2.5骨干网络，实验表明：(1)密集推理奖励可作为学习信号引导推理；(2)通过奖励引导的重排序提高了预测性能（特别是基于Llama的策略）。

Conclusion: 通过将训练信号、推理时选择和令牌级诊断统一到单一推理奖励中，这项工作表明可重用的过程级奖励具有增强语言模型中多步推理的广泛潜力。

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CARS方法，通过自适应剪枝技术提高约束生成的采样效率，既保持语言模型分布保真度，又避免计算浪费


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束生成方法存在两极化问题：贪婪约束解码会扭曲语言模型分布，而拒绝采样会浪费计算资源丢弃无效输出，在程序模糊测试等需要有效性和多样性的领域都有问题

Method: CARS从无约束语言模型采样开始，通过记录约束违反的连续序列到trie结构中，从未来采样中减去其概率质量，自适应地排除无效前缀

Result: 在程序模糊测试和分子生成等多个领域的实验中，CARS在采样效率（每个有效样本的语言模型前向传递次数）和样本多样性方面都优于现有方法

Conclusion: CARS严格提高了拒绝采样的样本效率而不产生分布扭曲，确保单调提高接受率，生成的样本完全遵循约束分布

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLMs与人类集体决策对齐的框架，通过Lost at Sea任务实验发现LLMs在集体推理中的行为存在差异，有些反映人类偏见，有些则试图补偿偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地用于建模和增强集体决策，需要检验它们与人类社会推理的对齐程度，特别是集体层面的对齐，而非个体层面。

Method: 使用Lost at Sea社会心理学任务进行大规模在线实验(N=748)，随机分配小组进行领导者选举，比较可见人口属性与匿名化条件。然后基于人类数据模拟匹配的LLM小组，评估多个模型的表现。

Result: LLMs行为出现分化：有些模型反映了人类偏见；有些则掩盖这些偏见并试图补偿。人类-AI在集体推理中的对齐取决于情境、线索和模型特定的归纳偏见。

Conclusion: 理解LLMs如何与集体人类行为对齐对于推进社会对齐AI至关重要，需要能够捕捉集体推理复杂性的动态基准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版生态系统面临提交量不可管理和AI不受监管的双重危机，需要新的治理模式来保障科学诚信，传统人工同行评审缺乏可扩展的客观基准。

Method: 采用确定性模拟框架，分析352份同行评审模拟报告，识别一致的系统状态指标来验证可靠性。

Result: 系统能够模拟校准的编辑判断，'修订'决定在所有学科中始终占多数(>50%)，'拒绝'率动态适应领域规范；保持稳定的程序完整性，证据锚定合规率稳定在29%。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI重新定位为机构问责的关键组成部分，为维护学术交流信任提供关键基础设施，为科学界提供确保公平的透明工具，为出版策略师提供可扩展的审计工具。

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly
communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格异常检测基准只提供原始数据点，缺乏文本语义上下文（如特征描述和领域知识），限制了研究灵活性并阻碍模型充分利用领域知识进行检测。

Method: 提供20个精心策划的表格数据集，包含结构化文本元数据，并实现了包括经典、深度学习和LLM方法在内的最先进异常检测算法，以及无需任务特定训练的零样本LLM框架。

Result: 实验结果显示语义上下文能提高检测性能，并通过支持领域感知推理增强可解释性。

Conclusion: ReTabAD为系统探索上下文感知异常检测建立了基准，证明文本元数据在异常检测中具有重要作用和实用性。

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

Motivation: 现有研究声称LLM深层贡献有限，但这些结论基于狭窄的评估，可能忽略了模型行为的重要方面。本文旨在系统研究不同维度下的深度利用情况。

Method: 系统研究深度利用，涵盖评估协议、任务类别和模型架构等多个维度，分析不同层在不同评估设置下的贡献。

Result: 深层通常不如浅层有效，但其贡献因评估设置而异。基于似然的评估中大多数层可剪枝，而生成式评估显示中深层对推理和连贯性不可或缺。知识集中在浅层，推理精度依赖深层但可通过蒸馏重塑。

Conclusion: LLM中的深度利用具有高度异质性和上下文依赖性，强调在解释和压缩大模型时需要任务、指标和模型感知的视角。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

Motivation: 企业级文档理解模型需要大规模、多样化的标注数据集，但传统数据收集方法成本高昂，受隐私和法律限制，手动标注成本可达数百万美元。

Method: 结合随机模式和参数化采样，通过概率建模布局模式、视觉结构和内容变异性，实现可控的大规模多样化文档变体生成。

Result: 在关键信息提取任务中，FlexDoc生成的数据将绝对F1分数提高了11%，同时相比传统硬模板方法减少了90%以上的标注工作量。

Conclusion: FlexDoc已在实际部署中加速了企业级文档理解模型的开发，同时显著降低了数据获取和标注成本。

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全技术（外部护栏、推理时指导、后训练对齐）在平衡安全性、实用性和可控性方面存在局限，需要更动态和模块化的安全控制方法

Method: 识别安全关键层并升级为稀疏MoE结构，路由器作为软护栏选择性激活原始MLP和安全专家；采用两阶段SFT策略；引入安全温度机制实现推理时动态控制

Result: 在多个基准测试、基础模型和模型规模上实现了对有害和越狱输入的稳健安全改进，同时在通用任务上保持竞争力；安全温度实现了效用和安全性的帕累托最优边界

Conclusion: 为LLM安全开辟了新方向：从静态对齐转向动态、模块化和推理感知的控制

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,
and inference-aware control.

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，提出的数据筛选算法显著提升了Pass@k性能。

Conclusion: RLVR的失败源于其固有的策略采样特性，通过针对性数据筛选可以缓解这一问题并提升性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN)方法，通过生成多个rollout并使用行为叙述进行选择，显著提高了计算机使用代理在复杂任务中的成功率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理在自动化日常数字任务方面具有潜力，但其不可靠性和高方差阻碍了在长期复杂任务中的应用。

Method: bBoN方法通过生成多个rollout并使用描述代理行为轨迹的叙述来进行选择，实现广泛探索和原则性轨迹选择。

Result: 在OSWorld上达到69.9%的最新SOTA，显著优于先前方法，接近人类72%的水平，并在WindowsAgentArena和AndroidWorld上展示出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 当正确实施时，扩展计算机使用代理具有不合理的高效性，有效扩展需要结构化的轨迹理解和选择，bBoN为此提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

TL;DR: 提出RLAD方法，通过推理抽象来引导模型学习有效的推理过程，包含抽象生成器和解决方案生成器的两玩家RL训练范式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大模型的推理轨迹往往无法一致地捕获或重用程序，而是陷入冗长和退化的探索，需要更有效的推理方法

Method: 引入推理抽象概念，训练模型能够为问题提出多个抽象，然后通过RL激励在利用这些抽象信息的基础上构建解决方案

Result: RLAD实现了结构化探索，解耦了抽象提议和解决方案生成的学习信号，并提高了对更难问题的泛化能力

Conclusion: 推理抽象能有效引导有意义的探索，在测试时分配更多计算资源生成抽象比生成更多解决方案更有利于性能提升

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

Conclusion: BioX-Bridge提供了一种高效的无监督跨模态知识转移框架，显著降低计算开销，为生物信号健康监测系统的可访问性和适应性提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
