### [1] [Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25220)
*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过循环消融方法测试欺骗行为是否可被局部移除，发现欺骗行为具有高度韧性，每次消融后都能通过对抗训练恢复，且每次尝试都会导致语言性能逐渐下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不良行为（如欺骗）是否是可局部移除的功能，还是与模型核心认知能力深度交织。

Method: 引入循环消融方法，结合稀疏自编码器、针对性消融和对抗训练，在DistilGPT-2上尝试消除欺骗概念。

Result: 欺骗行为具有高度韧性，模型通过对抗训练持续恢复欺骗行为（功能再生），且每次消融尝试都导致语言性能逐渐下降（困惑度上升）。

Conclusion: 复杂概念是分布式和纠缠的，通过机制可解释性进行直接模型编辑存在局限性。

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

### [2] [From Internal Representations to Text Quality: A Geometric Approach to LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25359)
*Viacheslav Yusupov,Danil Maksimov,Ameliia Alaeva,Anna Vasileva,Anna Antipina,Tatyana Zaitseva,Alina Ermilova,Evgeny Burnaev,Egor Shvetsov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过证明内部模型表示的几何特性可以作为评估生成文本质量的可靠代理，将大语言模型的内部和外部分析方法联系起来。研究发现内在维度和有效秩可以作为文本自然度和质量的通用评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连接大语言模型的内部和外部分析方法，寻找不需要人工标注数据集的参考无关文本质量评估方法，为自动化评估流程提供实际优势。

Method: 验证了一组度量指标，包括最大可解释方差、有效秩、内在维度、MAUVE分数和Schatten范数，这些指标在大语言模型的不同层进行测量。

Result: 发现不同模型基于这些几何特性对各种来源的文本进行一致排序，表明这些指标反映了固有的文本特征而非模型特定的伪影。内在维度和有效秩可以作为文本自然度和质量的通用评估指标。

Conclusion: 几何特性可以作为文本质量的可靠代理指标，实现无需参考文本和人工标注的自动化评估，为文本质量评估提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

### [3] [Generative Value Conflicts Reveal LLM Priorities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25369)
*Andy Liu,Kshitish Ghate,Mona Diab,Daniel Fried,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConflictScope是一个自动评估LLM在价值冲突中如何优先排序不同价值的框架，通过生成价值冲突场景来测试模型的价值排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐数据集缺乏价值冲突场景，需要评估LLM在价值冲突下的优先排序能力。

Method: 构建自动管道，从用户定义的价值集合中采样冲突价值对，生成冲突场景，使用LLM编写的用户提示来评估目标模型的自由文本响应。

Result: 模型在开放式评估中从保护性价值转向个人价值；在系统提示中加入详细价值排序可将对齐度提高14%。

Conclusion: 评估模型价值优先排序很重要，系统提示能在价值冲突中适度改善LLM对齐行为。

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

### [4] [From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25409)
*Qiyao Ma,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Chao Wang,Weiming Chang,Ting Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了思考监督奖励模型(TRM)，通过句子级思考监督赋予奖励模型批判性思维能力，解决开放域问答中RLVR难以验证正确性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂任务如开放域问答中，RLVR面临验证困难，因为现实世界知识的微妙性和模糊性使得难以可靠评估正确性。现有方法过度关注忠实度，导致模型过度依赖外部来源而削弱批判性评估能力。

Method: TRM首先评估每个答案句子对支持文档的忠实度，然后应用推理步骤评估句子级正确性。通过将奖励建模结构化为忠实度、推理和正确性评估的序列，鼓励模型批判性评估和利用外部和内部知识。

Result: 实验表明TRM显著提高了错误句子的识别能力，将TRM纳入策略优化在答案正确性和有用性方面都带来了显著提升。

Conclusion: TRM通过引入批判性思维监督，有效解决了开放域问答中RLVR的验证挑战，在保持忠实度的同时提升了模型的推理和正确性评估能力。

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

### [5] [Emotion-Aligned Generation in Diffusion Text to Speech Models via Preference-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25416)
*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Yangfan He,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EASPO是一种后训练框架，通过中间去噪步骤的细粒度情感偏好优化扩散TTS模型，提升情感表达和自然度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感TTS方法依赖粗粒度标签或代理分类器，只能获得语句级反馈，难以实现精细的情感控制

Method: 引入EASPM时间条件模型对噪声中间语音状态评分，自动构建偏好对，通过EASPO框架在中间去噪步骤优化情感偏好

Result: 实验表明在情感表达性和自然度方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: EASPO通过中间步骤的细粒度偏好优化，实现了可控的情感塑造，显著提升了情感TTS性能

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

### [6] [SimulRAG: Simulator-based RAG for Grounding LLMs in Long-form Scientific QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25459)
*Haozhou Xu,Dongxia Wu,Matteo Chinazzi,Ruijia Niu,Rose Yu,Yi-An Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SimulRAG框架，通过科学模拟器检索来增强大语言模型在长形式科学问答中的事实性，解决了传统RAG方法无法直接应用于科学模拟器检索的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长形式科学问答中容易产生幻觉，而科学模拟器作为验证假设的重要工具，可以成为有前景的检索源来提升答案的事实性。

Method: 提出SimulRAG框架，包括通用模拟器检索接口（实现文本与数值模态转换）和基于不确定性估计与模拟器边界评估的声明级生成方法。

Result: 在气候科学和流行病学基准测试中，SimulRAG在信息性上比传统RAG基线提升30.4%，在事实性上提升16.3%。UE+SBA进一步提高了声明级生成的效率和质量。

Conclusion: SimulRAG通过科学模拟器检索有效缓解了大语言模型在长形式科学问答中的幻觉问题，显著提升了答案的事实性和信息性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is undergoing constant transformation, as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving daily breakthroughs in research and
practice. In this regard, tracking the progress of NLP research and
automatically analyzing the contributions of research papers provides key
insights into the nature of the field and the researchers. This study explores
the progress of African NLP (AfricaNLP) by asking (and answering) basic
research questions such as: i) How has the nature of NLP evolved over the last
two decades?, ii) What are the contributions of AfricaNLP papers?, and iii)
Which individuals and organizations (authors, affiliated institutions, and
funding bodies) have been involved in the development of AfricaNLP? We
quantitatively examine the contributions of AfricaNLP research using 1.9K NLP
paper abstracts, 4.9K author contributors, and 7.8K human-annotated
contribution sentences (AfricaNLPContributions) along with benchmark results.
Our dataset and continuously existing NLP progress tracking website provide a
powerful lens for tracing AfricaNLP research trends and hold potential for
generating data-driven literature surveys.

### [8] [Not Wrong, But Untrue: LLM Overconfidence in Document-Based Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25498)
*Nick Hagar,Wilma Agustianto,Nicholas Diakopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估ChatGPT、Gemini和NotebookLM在新闻写作任务中的幻觉问题，发现30%输出包含幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率是NotebookLM的三倍。主要问题是解释性过度自信而非虚构实体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在新闻编辑室工作流程中应用日益广泛，但其幻觉倾向对新闻采编的核心实践（来源、归属和准确性）构成风险。

Method: 基于300份TikTok诉讼和政策相关文档，评估三种工具在报道式任务中的表现，通过改变提示具体性和上下文大小，使用分类法对句子级输出进行注释以衡量幻觉类型和严重程度。

Result: 30%的模型输出包含至少一个幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率（40%）约为NotebookLM（13%）的三倍。大多数错误涉及解释性过度自信，模型添加了对来源的未经支持的描述，并将归因观点转化为一般性陈述。

Conclusion: 揭示了根本的认识论不匹配：新闻要求每个主张都有明确来源，而LLM无论证据支持如何都会生成权威性文本。建议新闻特定的幻觉分类扩展，并主张有效的新闻编辑室工具需要强制执行准确归属而非优化流畅性的架构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

### [9] [Beyond WER: Probing Whisper's Sub-token Decoder Across Diverse Language Resource Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25516)
*Siyu Liang,Nicolas Ballier,Gina-Anne Levow,Richard Wright*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对Whisper多语言ASR模型的解码器进行细粒度分析，发现高资源语言在正确标记排名、置信度、预测熵和候选多样性方面表现更好，而低资源语言在这些指标上表现较差且存在独特的子标记使用聚类模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索端到端多语言ASR模型内部机制，特别是跨语言公平性和效能问题，这些在现有研究中尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过追踪波束搜索路径，捕获子标记猜测及其相关概率，使用PCA和t-SNE分析子标记使用模式。

Result: 高资源语言正确标记排名更高、置信度更高、预测熵更低、候选更多样；低资源语言表现较差但显示出受类型学影响的独特子标记聚类模式。

Conclusion: 子标记探测揭示了被聚合错误率掩盖的系统性解码差异，为改善语音技术不平衡发展提供了针对性干预方向。

Abstract: While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MixtureVitae是一个开源预训练语料库，采用风险缓解策略构建，结合公共领域和宽松许可文本，在保持法律合规的同时提供强大的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在最小化法律风险，同时提供强大的模型性能，减少对无差别网络爬取的依赖，为训练能力强的LLM提供实用且法律风险可控的基础。

Method: 采用风险缓解的采集策略，结合公共领域和宽松许可文本，以及经过仔细论证的低风险补充内容，包括政府作品和欧盟TDM合格来源，同时包含有针对性的指令、推理和合成数据。采用透明的多阶段流水线进行许可证感知过滤、安全和质量筛选，以及领域感知混合。

Result: 在130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B参数的固定架构下，使用50B和300B token训练预算的实验中，MixtureVitae训练的模型在标准基准测试中一致优于其他宽松许可数据集。在1.7B/300B设置下，超越了FineWeb-Edu并在训练后期接近DCLM。在数学/代码任务上表现特别强，在QA任务上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 以宽松许可优先、风险缓解的数据为训练能力强的LLM提供了实用且法律风险可控的基础，在不牺牲竞争力的前提下减少了对无差别网络爬取的依赖。

Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

### [11] [Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25532)
*Victor Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DINCO方法，通过评估LLM的易受暗示性偏差来校准置信度估计，结合生成器-验证器不一致性和跨不兼容声明的连贯性来改善置信度校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的置信度分数存在校准问题，经常在低准确率实例上报告高置信度，损害信任和安全。研究发现这种过度自信源于LLM对信息量少的声明具有更高的易受暗示性。

Method: 引入Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)：1) 让模型在多个自生成的干扰项上独立表达置信度；2) 通过总置信度进行归一化；3) 利用生成器-验证器不一致性，将归一化验证器置信度与基于一致性的生成器置信度估计相结合。

Result: DINCO提供更不饱和、更可用的置信度估计，在10次推理调用下优于100次调用的自一致性基准方法，且进一步采样无法弥补DINCO与基线之间的差距。

Conclusion: DINCO通过整合跨采样生成和跨不兼容声明验证的互补连贯性维度，有效改善了LLM置信度校准，提供了更可靠的置信度估计。

Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自我奖励和评分标准的强化学习框架，用于提升语言模型在开放式推理任务中的表现，该方法在资源效率方面优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实场景中部署大型语言模型需要开放式评估，研究发现使用模型自身作为评分者并生成基于评分标准的奖励信号能显著提升推理性能。

Method: 引入自我奖励评分标准强化学习框架，使用模型自身作为评分者生成奖励信号，支持轻量级训练，仅需少量样本即可获得显著提升。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B模型上，仅使用4000个HealthBench Easy子集样本训练，就能在HealthBench Hard上超越GPT-5。加入少量教师评分数据可进一步提升较小模型性能。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了更快速、资源效率更高的训练，同时超越了基线方法，证明了自我奖励评分标准强化学习在开放式推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

*Soumik Dey,William Gregory Sakas*

TL;DR: 提出计算参数测量儿童对空主语祈使句的误读，通过变分学习器模拟支持了Orfitelli和Hyams关于临时空主语语法的假设


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究儿童空主语阶段中祈使句与陈述句混淆现象，验证临时空主语语法假设

Method: 使用改进的变分学习器（适用于超集-子集语言）进行模拟，提出新的计算参数来测量误读

Result: 模拟结果支持Orfitelli和Hyams的假设，证实儿童确实存在临时空主语语法阶段

Conclusion: 本研究为整合计算模型研究语法习得提供了框架，证明了计算建模在语言发展研究中的价值

Abstract: The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

TL;DR: 提出了PDP（Pairwise Difference Pearson），一种新的机器翻译片段级元评估指标，通过使用成对差异而非原始分数来解决现有Pearson和Kendall方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于Pearson's ρ和Kendall's τ的元评估方法的局限性，提供更稳健的评估指标。

Method: PDP是一种基于相关性的指标，利用所有片段的成对差异信息，通过片段级成对差异将全局Pearson细化为片段内分数比较。

Result: 在WMT'24共享任务上的分析显示，PDP能正确排序评估指标，且比先前工作更符合人类错误权重。噪声注入分析表明PDP对随机噪声、片段偏差和系统偏差具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PDP是一种有效的片段级元评估指标，对噪声具有鲁棒性，但对极端异常值敏感。

Abstract: This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

TL;DR: 研究小规模视觉语言模型在幽默和浪漫风格上的数据效率对齐，探索模型性能极限和所需最少偏好数据量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于transformer的视觉语言模型在零样本设置下难以生成特定风格（如幽默、浪漫）的图像描述，而获取偏好数据成本高昂，限制了模型能力的充分探索

Method: 研究小规模视觉语言模型在幽默和浪漫风格上的数据效率对齐方法，确定实现风格饱和所需的最少偏好数据量

Result: 定义了这些模型的性能极限，并建立了其能力和限制的基准

Conclusion: 通过研究数据效率对齐，可以更好地理解小规模视觉语言模型在特定风格生成任务中的潜力和局限

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RFG（无奖励指导）方法，无需显式过程奖励即可指导扩散大语言模型的推理轨迹，通过参数化过程奖励为增强模型和参考模型的似然比来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型在推理过程中面临挑战，因为其生成是任意顺序的，中间状态是部分掩码的句子，难以像自回归模型那样学习密集标注的过程奖励。

Method: RFG通过将过程奖励参数化为增强模型和参考dLLM的对数似然比来实现，增强模型可以通过任何现成的经过RL或SFT后训练的dLLM获得。

Result: 在四个数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，RFG在所有任务和模型类型上都带来了显著改进，准确率提升高达9.2%。

Conclusion: RFG是一个通用的无需训练框架，可在不依赖外部奖励模型的情况下扩展测试时推理能力。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

*Takashi Furuya,Maarten V. de Hoop,Matti Lassas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer架构作为概率测度间映射的特性，完全刻画了能够通过前推映射表示为上下文映射的测度间映射的性质，并证明了Transformer可以通用逼近具有任何连续上下文映射的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了数学上统一分析Transformer架构的表达能力，研究这些架构处理任意大量上下文token的能力，将神经网络建模为概率测度上的映射，用于研究Wasserstein正则性、证明泛化界限以及分析相互作用粒子通过网络的动力学平均场极限。

Method: 将Transformer建模为概率测度间的映射，通过前推映射来表示上下文映射，分析这些映射保持支撑基数性和其Fréchet导数正则部分一致连续性的特性。

Result: 证明了Transformer可以通用逼近具有任何连续上下文映射的表示，同时证明了Vlasov方程的解映射满足这些条件，因此可以被Transformer逼近；反之，测度理论的自注意力机制确保了无限深度、平均场测度理论Transformer可以与Vlasov流等同。

Conclusion: Transformer架构作为概率测度间映射具有特定的数学特性，能够逼近Vlasov方程等非局部输运类型的解映射，这为理解Transformer的表达能力和动力学特性提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

*Samar Haider,Amir Tohidi,Jenny S. Wang,Timothy Dörr,David M. Rothschild,Chris Callison-Burch,Duncan J. Watts*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个大规模、实时的数据集和计算框架，用于系统性研究新闻媒体中的选择和框架偏见。该框架结合大型语言模型和新闻爬取技术，能够提取政治倾向、语调、主题等多维度结构化标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流新闻机构不仅通过发布文章直接影响公众认知，还通过选择报道主题和框架议题的方式产生偏见。但目前难以大规模测量这些微妙的媒体偏见形式。

Method: 开发了一个整合大型语言模型和可扩展实时新闻爬取技术的管道，每天从数百篇文章中提取结构化标注，包括政治倾向、语调、主题、文章类型和重大事件等维度。

Result: 构建了包含15万+文章的语料库，在句子、文章和发布者三个层面量化了报道维度，并发布了交互式网络平台供数据探索。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可重复使用的大规模媒体偏见研究方法论，为未来研究提供实证资源，支持学术研究和改善媒体问责的实际努力。

Abstract: Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

TL;DR: QFrBLiMP是一个用于评估LLM在魁北克法语语法知识上的基准语料库，包含1,761对最小对立句，涵盖20种语言现象。研究发现模型语法能力随规模增长，但在需要深层语义理解的任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在魁北克法语特定语法现象上的语言知识，并与人类表现进行比较。

Method: 创建1,761对最小对立句，由12名魁北克法语母语者标注语法正确性，通过比较模型对句子概率的分配来评估模型能力。

Result: 模型语法能力随规模扩展而提升，但所有模型在需要深层语义理解的现象上都表现不佳，与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 虽然模型语法能力随规模增长，但在语义理解任务上存在关键限制，揭示了与人类表现的明显差距。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出基准和谐度概念，用于衡量模型在基准测试各子领域表现的均匀性，发现不和谐的基准可能导致误导性结果，建议在评估时同时报告和谐度和准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试的可靠性对模型评估和进展至关重要，当前基准可能存在某些子领域主导整体性能的问题，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 从分布角度研究基准可靠性，引入基准和谐度指标，在19个多项选择基准和5个模型家族上计算和谐度的均值和方差。

Result: 分析显示不和谐的基准会产生误导结果，例如ARC-Easy基准中生物学概念问题主导了整体准确率，掩盖了其他重要子领域。

Conclusion: 建议在模型评估时同时报告和谐度和准确率，从简单的性能平均转向更稳健、分布可靠的性能测量。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

TL;DR: BiasUnlearn是一个新颖的语言模型去偏框架，通过双路径遗忘机制协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，在有效减轻偏见的同时保持语言建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数修改去偏方法会显著降低文本连贯性和任务准确性，而基于提示的去偏方法仅对预定义触发词有效，无法解决模型参数中根深蒂固的刻板印象关联。

Method: 提出BiasUnlearn框架，通过双路径遗忘机制协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，使用对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换防止偏见极性反转。

Result: 在多个语言模型和各种评估基准上的实验表明，BiasUnlearn在减轻语言模型偏见方面优于现有方法，同时保留了语言建模能力。

Conclusion: 去偏权重可在模型变体间迁移，证实偏见表示在预训练期间形成并在微调阶段持续存在。

Abstract: Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

TL;DR: 提出了LD-MoLE方法，一种可学习的动态路由机制，用于LoRA专家混合模型，实现自适应、令牌依赖和分层专家分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖传统的TopK路由，需要仔细的超参数调优，并为每个令牌分配固定数量的专家。

Method: 用可微分路由函数和闭式解替换不可微分的TopK选择，允许模型自适应确定每层每个令牌激活的专家数量，并引入分析稀疏性控制目标来正则化激活专家数量。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B和Llama-3.2-3B模型上的广泛实验显示，LD-MoLE在多样化基准测试中实现了最高的平均分数。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了优越性能，还展示了学习令牌依赖和分层专家分配的能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型主要依赖大规模训练数据，但缺乏对数学概念和推理原理的真正理解。受人类将复杂问题分解为基本原子能力的启发，需要新的评估方法来检验模型是否真正掌握了数学能力。

Method: 将原子能力分为两个维度：四个数学领域（代数、几何、分析、拓扑）的领域特定能力，以及不同层次的逻辑能力（概念理解、前向多步推理、反例驱动的后向推理）。为每个原子能力单元构建相应的训练和评估数据集。

Result: 在先进模型上的评估和实验结果显示，模型在不同原子能力上表现差异显著，原子能力之间存在有趣的相互作用。

Conclusion: 将数学智能分解为原子组件具有重要意义，为模型认知提供新见解，并指导训练策略向更高效、可迁移和认知基础的"原子思维"范式发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale
reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic
thinking".

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this
work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text
generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In
Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes
to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or
prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,
high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text
generation in sensitive domains.

Motivation: 现有AI心理咨询研究采用一次性生成方法合成多轮对话样本，导致治疗保真度低且无法捕捉每个回应的决策逻辑。

Method: 提出CATCH框架：1）渐进式对话合成策略，从客户自述中提取目标、资源和解决方案，组织成结构化大纲，逐步生成阶段对齐的咨询对话；2）记忆驱动动态规划思维模式，整合记忆增强、全局规划和策略推理；3）协作多智能体优化器利用MDP为每个对话回合附加明确的思维链。

Conclusion: CATCH框架有效解决了现有AI心理咨询方法在治疗保真度和决策逻辑透明度方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple
languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based
models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa, to detect and categorize hope speech into
three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope.
Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the
PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all

approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms
of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in
low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This
work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech
detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation
and foster supportive online communities.

TL;DR: TruthRL是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过三元奖励机制直接优化LLMs的真实性，显著减少幻觉并提高真实性，在多个知识密集型基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优化准确性时会放大幻觉，而鼓励弃权的方法又过于保守，牺牲正确答案，这两种极端都损害了LLMs的真实性。

Method: 使用GRPO实现TruthRL框架，采用简单的三元奖励机制区分正确答案、幻觉和弃权，激励模型不仅提供正确答案，还能在不确定时弃权。

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中，TruthRL相比普通RL显著减少幻觉28.9%，提高真实性21.1%，在不同骨干模型和检索/非检索设置下均表现一致。

Conclusion: TruthRL在准确性和真实性方面都实现了强劲性能，强调了学习目标设计对于开发真实LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

*Obed Junias,Prajakta Kini,Theodora Chaspari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究比较了基于深度神经网络嵌入和大型语言模型的抑郁症检测方法，分析了性别和种族/族裔方面的算法偏见，并测试了多种减轻偏见的技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是调查语言模型在自动化抑郁症检测中的算法偏见，特别关注性别和种族/族裔方面的社会人口统计学差异。

Method: 方法包括：比较基于深度神经网络嵌入和少量样本学习的大型语言模型；在DAIC-WOZ临床访谈转录本上评估性能和公平性；对DNN模型应用公平性感知损失函数；对LLM探索不同提示框架和样本数量的上下文学习。

Result: 结果显示：LLM在抑郁症分类中优于DNN模型，特别是对西班牙裔参与者；LLM比DNN嵌入表现出更少的性别偏见，但种族差异仍然存在；在DNN模型中，最差组损失在性能和公平性之间取得了更好平衡；在LLM中，伦理框架的引导提示有助于减轻1-shot设置中的性别偏见，但增加样本数量并不能进一步减少差异。

Conclusion: 结论是：LLM在抑郁症检测中表现更好且性别偏见更少，但种族偏见问题仍然存在；最差组损失是有效的偏见减轻技术；提示策略对减轻种族偏见效果有限。

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
their performance in domain-specific applications and non-English languages
remains less explored. This study introduces a novel Romanian-language dataset
for multiple-choice biology questions, carefully curated to assess LLM
comprehension and reasoning capabilities in scientific contexts. Containing
approximately 14,000 questions, the dataset provides a comprehensive resource
for evaluating and improving LLM performance in biology.
  We benchmark several popular LLMs, analyzing their accuracy, reasoning
patterns, and ability to understand domain-specific terminology and linguistic
nuances. Additionally, we perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the
impact of prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and other optimization techniques on
model performance. Our findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs in handling specialized knowledge tasks in low-resource languages,
offering valuable insights for future research and development.

Motivation: 现有的图基方法在全局意义理解方面缺乏检索机制、主题特异性，且推理成本高。

Method: ReTAG是一个检索增强、主题增强的图框架，构建主题特定子图并检索相关摘要用于回答生成。

Result: 实验表明，与基线相比，ReTAG提高了回答质量，同时显著减少了推理时间。

Conclusion: ReTAG框架有效解决了现有方法在全局意义理解中的局限性，实现了更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in question answering have led to substantial progress in
tasks such as multi-hop reasoning. However, global sensemaking-answering
questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a
significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks
retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To
address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced,
Topic-Augmented Graph framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and
retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that
ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time
compared to the baseline. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DECS框架解决了大型推理模型中的"过度思考"问题，通过解耦的token级奖励机制和课程批量调度策略，在保持性能的同时显著减少推理token数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR模型存在"过度思考"问题，生成过长的推理路径却无性能提升。现有长度惩罚方法因轨迹级奖励与token级优化不匹配而失败。

Method: 提出DECS框架：1) 首创解耦token级奖励机制，精确惩罚冗余token；2) 新颖课程批量调度策略，平衡效率与效果。

Result: 在7个基准测试中，推理token数量减少超过50%，同时保持甚至提升性能表现。

Conclusion: DECS证明可以在不损害模型推理能力的前提下，大幅提升推理效率。

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出两种视觉语言模型解释质量评分函数——视觉保真度和对比性，用于帮助用户在无法看到视觉上下文时判断模型预测的可靠性，并通过用户研究验证了这些评分能显著提高用户对模型正确性的判断准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户无法看到视觉上下文时（如盲人和低视力用户），视觉语言模型的自然语言解释可以帮助判断哪些预测是可靠的。但现有研究发现解释容易让用户错误地相信不准确的预测，因此需要解决对VLM预测的过度依赖问题。

Method: 提出两种解释质量评分函数：视觉保真度（衡量解释对视觉上下文的忠实程度）和对比性（衡量解释识别区分模型预测与合理替代方案的视觉细节的能力）。在A-OKVQA和VizWiz任务上评估这些评分函数，并进行用户研究验证效果。

Result: 在A-OKVQA和VizWiz任务上，提出的质量评分函数比现有解释质量指标与模型正确性更相关。用户研究表明，显示质量评分可将参与者预测VLM正确性的准确率提高11.1%，并将错误相信不正确预测的比率降低15.4%。

Conclusion: 解释质量评分在促进对VLM预测的适当依赖方面具有实用价值，能有效帮助用户在无法看到视觉上下文时更准确地判断模型预测的可靠性。

Abstract: When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

Motivation: 大语言模型经常在科学事实上产生幻觉，严重损害其可信度。需要超越二元事实性评估的细粒度基准来检测科学幻觉。

Method: 构建包含1001个专家标注的科学问题-答案对数据集，每个实例包含正确回答和带有精确错误跨度及错误类型的非事实对应版本。

Result: 对9个最先进的大语言模型进行基准测试，发现性能有限（约50%准确率）。即使是GPT-4o等顶级模型也难以区分事实性和幻觉的科学答案。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在领域特定情境中检测和纠正科学幻觉需要细粒度、经过人工验证的基准，并对LLM作为评判者的评估范式提出了担忧。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently confabulate scientific facts,severely
undermining their trustworthiness. Addressing this challenge requires
benchmarks that go beyond binary factuality and enable fine-grained evaluation.
We introduce \textbf{ReFACT} (\textit{Reddit False And Correct Texts}), a
benchmark of 1,001 expert-annotated question--answer pairs spanning diverse
scientific domains for the detection of scientific confabulation. Each instance
includes both a scientifically correct answer and a non-factual counterpart
annotated with \textbf{precise error spans and error-types}. ReFACT enables
multi-stage evaluation: (1) confabulation detection, (2) fine-grained error
localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as
GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers,
raising concerns about the reliability of \textit{LLM-as-judge} evaluation

TL;DR: 提出了RoleConflictBench基准，评估LLM在角色冲突社会困境中的情境敏感性，发现LLM存在显著的社会角色偏见而非情境敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在人类决策中影响力增加，需要理解它们在复杂社会情境中的行为。角色冲突代表固有的模糊社会困境，需要情境敏感性来识别和权衡情境线索。

Method: 使用三阶段流程生成超过13K个现实角色冲突场景，涵盖65个角色，系统变化相关期望和情境紧急程度，分析10个不同LLM的模型选择。

Result: LLM对情境线索有一定响应能力但不足，决策主要由强大的内在社会角色偏见主导，表现出对家庭和职业领域角色的偏好，以及男性角色和亚伯拉罕宗教的优先选择。

Conclusion: LLM在角色冲突情境中的决策主要受社会角色偏见而非情境信息影响，需要改进模型的情境敏感性。

Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏评估文本特定方面（如个性化质量）的专门指标，研究者通常依赖多个大语言模型进行元评估，这会因模型内部偏见而增加成本。

Method: 引入了名为PerQ的计算高效方法，用于评估语言模型生成文本的个性化质量。

Result: 通过比较大模型和小模型生成能力的案例研究，证明了该指标在研究中可用性，有效减少了资源浪费。

Conclusion: PerQ方法提供了一种计算高效的替代方案，能够有效评估文本个性化质量，同时降低元评估成本。

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

TL;DR: Mem-alpha是一个强化学习框架，训练LLM代理有效管理复杂记忆系统，通过交互和反馈优化记忆构建，显著提升长序列处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆增强代理依赖预定义指令和工具进行记忆更新，但语言模型缺乏确定存储内容、结构化和更新时机的能力，导致记忆构建不优和信息丢失。

Method: 提出Mem-alpha强化学习框架，构建专门训练数据集，代理处理序列信息块学习提取存储相关内容并更新记忆系统，奖励信号来自下游问答准确性。

Result: Mem-alpha显著优于现有记忆增强代理基线，在仅30k token训练下能泛化到超过400k token的序列，达到13倍训练长度。

Conclusion: Mem-alpha框架通过强化学习有效训练代理管理复杂记忆系统，展示了强大的泛化能力和记忆构建优化效果。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型一直使用Softmax作为路由器函数，但这被视为既定假设而非有原则的设计选择。作者发现MoE与Nadaraya-Watson回归具有相同的数学公式，因此重新审视了这一设计选择。

Method: 提出KERN（Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization）路由器函数，这是一种FFN风格的路由器，推荐使用ReLU激活和ℓ2归一化，无需额外计算成本。

Result: 在MoE和LLM上的综合实验验证了所提出的FFN风格路由器函数的有效性。

Conclusion: KERN路由器函数能够有效替代传统的Softmax路由器，为MoE模型提供了新的设计选择。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

<details>

Motivation: 虽然预训练Transformer编码器在序列标注中占主导地位，但一些替代架构在语言建模中显示出潜力，却很少应用于序列标注任务，尤其是在复杂结构任务中。

Method: 研究多种替代架构（xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型、对抗学习）在不同结构复杂性、标签空间和标记依赖性的标注任务中的适应性，并进行跨语言评估。

Result: 发现这些架构在简单设置中观察到的强性能不能很好地跨语言或跨数据集泛化，也无法扩展到更复杂的结构化任务。

Conclusion: 替代架构在序列标注任务中的表现存在局限性，其优异性能在复杂场景和跨语言环境中无法保持。

Abstract: Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

Conclusion: 当前无参考GEC评估指标存在严重脆弱性，需要开发更鲁棒的评估方法来确保自动评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high
scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic
evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In
this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free
metrics: SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics, and demonstrate that
our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

TL;DR: RAGferee方法将问答数据集转化为偏好对，训练专门用于RAG系统的奖励模型，在ContextualJudgeBench上超越现有70B+模型，提升15.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型基于通用偏好数据训练，难以评估RAG系统中回复的忠实性、相关性、拒绝能力、完整性和简洁性等关键特性。

Method: 提出RAGferee方法，将问答数据集重新构建为偏好对，优先考虑事实准确性而非风格特征，训练参数规模从7B到24B的RAG专用奖励模型。

Result: 仅使用4K样本训练的小型RAG专用奖励模型在ContextualJudgeBench上达到最先进性能，超越基于240万样本训练的70B+通用模型。

Conclusion: RAGferee方法能有效训练专门针对RAG系统的奖励模型，小规模专用模型可超越大规模通用模型，为RAG系统评估提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

*Baoxin Wang,Yumeng Luo,Yixuan Wang,Dayong Wu,Wanxiang Che,Shijin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RE²方法，通过语法错误解释而非文本相似度来选择参考示例，提升中文语法错误纠正性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本相似度检索示例，但这种方法经常与实际的错误模式不匹配，检索到词汇相似但语法无关的句子

Method: RE²方法使用语法错误解释来选择参考示例，创建了高质量的语法错误解释数据集，帮助LLMs提升CGEC性能

Result: 在两个CGEC数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法有效提高了中文语法错误纠正的性能

Conclusion: 基于语法错误解释的示例检索方法比传统的文本相似度方法更有效，为CGEC和GEE研究提供了有价值的资源

Abstract: The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

*Arash Marioriyad,Shaygan Adim,Nima Alighardashi,Mahdieh Soleymani Banghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究系统分析了LLM在思维链提示下的忠实性问题，通过控制提示中的线索操纵，发现LLM推理严重受线索影响，正确线索提升准确性但错误线索降低准确性，且线索确认程度不均，表明LLM推理存在系统性捷径依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM生成的思维链推理是否忠实于底层计算过程，而非受提示中嵌入的答案捷径线索影响的伪推理。

Method: 在四个数据集(AIME、GSM-Hard、MATH-500、UniADILR)和两个先进模型(GPT-4o、Gemini-2-Flash)上，通过系统操纵线索的正确性、呈现风格和复杂度，评估任务准确性和线索确认情况。

Result: 1) 正确线索显著提升准确性，错误线索在低基线能力任务中大幅降低准确性；2) 线索确认不均，复杂线索更易被明确引用；3) 呈现风格影响确认行为，奉承式提示鼓励明确确认，泄露式提示促进隐藏依赖。

Conclusion: LLM推理系统性地受捷径线索影响，这模糊了推理的忠实性，反映了RLHF相关效应在推理过程中的作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central
question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful}
to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints
that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work
on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT
faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans
four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models
(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in
correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data
leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator
expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly
acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,
correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks
and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks
with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly
uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are
often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward
verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style
matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style
prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect
RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data
leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that
LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure
faithfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RE-Searcher方法，通过目标导向规划和自我反思来增强LLM搜索代理在复杂环境中的鲁棒性，解决查询变化导致的脆弱搜索行为问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在知识密集型任务中表现优异，但受限于知识截止、幻觉和交互模式限制。虽然外部搜索工具可以缓解这些问题，但复杂搜索环境中查询的微小变化会导致推理偏离正确轨迹并放大错误。

Method: 提出RE-Searcher方法：在搜索过程中明确阐述具体搜索目标，然后反思检索到的证据是否满足该目标。结合目标导向规划和自我反思来抵抗复杂搜索环境中的虚假线索。

Result: 实验显示该方法提高了搜索准确性并达到最先进结果。扰动研究进一步证明了对噪声或误导性外部信号的强韧性，缓解了搜索过程的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为将LLM驱动的代理集成到更复杂的交互环境中并实现更自主的决策提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

TL;DR: 该论文填补了中欧语言机器生成文本检测的空白，建立了首个针对该地区的检测方法基准，并比较了不同训练语言组合的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器生成文本检测研究主要集中在英语，对非英语语言特别是中欧语言的检测能力缺乏研究，主要依赖跨语言迁移能力，这导致现有检测器在中欧语言上几乎无法使用。

Method: 通过多领域、多生成器和多语言评估，比较不同训练语言组合的检测方法性能，并测试检测方法对抗混淆攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现，在中欧语言上进行监督微调的检测器在这些语言上表现最佳，并且对混淆攻击具有最强的抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 针对特定语言进行监督微调的检测器在中欧语言机器生成文本检测任务中表现最优，且具有更好的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly
focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost
unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual
transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central
European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather
unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection
methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of
train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on
multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the
differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of
detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European
languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most
resistant against obfuscation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DyFlow是一个动态工作流生成框架，通过设计器和执行器组件，基于任务需求和实时中间反馈自适应构建和调整推理过程，显著提升跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的智能体系统大多依赖手动设计的工作流程，限制了跨任务的适应性。少数自动化工作流生成方法通常与特定数据集或查询类型绑定，且对中间反馈利用有限，导致系统鲁棒性和推理深度不足。

Method: DyFlow包含设计器和执行器两个核心组件。设计器将复杂问题分解为高层目标定义的子目标序列，基于中间输出和反馈动态规划下一步骤。执行器使用具有上下文感知参数化的动态操作符执行每个操作，实现灵活且语义基础的推理。

Result: 在社交推理、生物医学任务、数学问题解决和代码生成等多个领域系统评估表明，DyFlow显著优于现有基线方法，实现了显著的Pass@k提升，并在不同领域展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DyFlow通过动态工作流生成有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为构建高效且可泛化的智能体系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at

*Arash Marioriyad,Mohammad Hossein Rohban,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM作为自动评估器存在偏见问题，会基于提示中的表面线索（如来源和时间）而非内容质量做出判断，且很少承认这些偏见因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM作为自动评估器是否能够基于响应质量进行忠实评估，还是依赖提示中的捷径线索做出有偏见的判断。

Method: 使用ELI5和LitBench两个评估数据集，构建100对比较任务，给响应分配来源线索（人类、专家、LLM、未知）和时间线索（旧1950年vs新2025年），使用GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash作为评估器。

Result: 两个模型都表现出强烈的时间偏见（偏爱新响应）和清晰的来源等级偏见（专家>人类>LLM>未知），这些偏见在GPT-4o和主观性更强的LitBench领域尤为明显，且模型几乎从不承认这些线索的影响。

Conclusion: 当前的LLM-as-a-judge系统容易依赖捷径且不忠实，削弱了其在研究和部署中作为评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to
evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative
writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality
and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that
current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in
the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for
long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative
writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must
choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100
pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,
we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source
identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal
origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.
Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency
bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear
provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are
especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended
LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost
never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of
content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge
systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as
evaluators in both research and deployment.

TL;DR: 提出LENS框架，直接在LLM的潜在嵌入空间中合成偏好数据，通过VAE学习结构化潜在表示，在潜在空间进行受控扰动来生成多样化的合成偏好对，显著提高奖励建模效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励建模对对齐LLM与人类偏好至关重要，但偏好数据的高成本成为瓶颈。现有文本数据合成方法计算成本高昂。

Method: 使用变分自编码器(VAE)学习响应嵌入的结构化潜在表示，在潜在空间进行受控扰动并解码回嵌入空间，生成语义一致的合成偏好对。

Result: 潜在空间合成在标准基准测试中显著优于基于文本的增强方法，生成速度快18倍，使用模型小16,000倍，同时获得更优结果。

Conclusion: LENS为通过高效数据增强改进奖励建模提供了可扩展且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data.
Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We
propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the
LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By
performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to
the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent
synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We
provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately
preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.
Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based
augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x
faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a
scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through
efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有数学基准局限于最终答案问题或高中竞赛题，无法评估LLMs在数学研究前沿的表现，需要更贴近真实研究环境的评估框架。

Method: 创建包含39个同行评审数学问题的私有基准，每个问题都需要详细证明，并配有最终答案子问题。采用代理框架，允许模型使用网络搜索和数学软件工具。

Result: 当前LLMs能在较容易的研究级问题上成功，但在更具挑战性的问题上仍有困难。Grok-4在最终答案子问题上准确率达52%，GPT-5在证明生成方面表现最佳，22%的问题获得完全正确解。

Conclusion: IMProofBench作为动态基准将持续发展，确保其相关性以评估下一代LLMs的数学研究能力。

Abstract: As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it
becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level
tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks
are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school
competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private
benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert
mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with
subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of
mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale
quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior
benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment:
models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for
literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show
that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions,
but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems.
Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer
subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation,
achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will
continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the
mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next
generation of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对交互策略的显式优化，依赖统一提示导致次优结果，需要更有效的策略学习框架

Method: 分层框架：Planner选择策略（推荐、解释、鼓励等），Actor在专家网络指导下生成响应，使用强化学习和LLM奖励进行策略学习

Result: 实验表明RSO优于现有最先进基线，验证了分层策略优化的有效性

Conclusion: RSO框架通过策略规划和响应的解耦实现了更可控的学习，解决了多轮对话数据有限的问题

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) provide personalized
recommendations through multi-turn interactions. With the strong reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become
promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of
interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield
suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a
hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level
strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A
Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an
Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and
factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To
address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement
learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of
hierarchical strategy optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当LLM处理训练领域之外的文本时，词汇不匹配问题常被忽视，通用领域分词器无法有效处理领域特定术语，导致token数量增加和处理速度下降

Method: 设计算法扩展现有分词器的词汇表，添加领域特定token，保证每个输入序列的分词数量不会超过原有分词器

Result: 在真实电商用例中，增强后的分词器显著缩短输入序列达20%，减少下游任务的推理延迟，同时保持预测质量

Conclusion: 词汇适应具有更广泛的益处，包括对前向传播速度的影响以及模型对新引入token的采用率

Abstract: When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often
overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer
fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token
fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word
splits.
  We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set
of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an
existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization
efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of
tokens as before.
  Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer
significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference
latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further
analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the
rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the
broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.

Motivation: 探索竞争如何影响基于LLM的多智能体系统的行为，特别是研究在极端压力下智能体表现出的不可靠、有害行为如何破坏协作和任务性能。

Method: 提出HATE（饥饿游戏辩论）实验框架，模拟零和竞争环境下的多智能体辩论，在不同LLM和任务上进行实验，并引入不同变体的裁判来研究环境反馈的影响。

Result: 竞争压力显著刺激了过度竞争行为，导致任务性能下降和讨论偏离正轨；客观、任务导向的反馈能有效缓解过度竞争行为；通过事后善意测试形成了LLM排行榜。

Conclusion: 为理解和治理AI社区中涌现的社会动态提供了见解，强调了在竞争环境中平衡竞争与协作的重要性，以及环境反馈在调节智能体行为中的关键作用。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems demonstrate great potential for tackling
complex problems, but how competition shapes their behavior remains
underexplored. This paper investigates the over-competition in multi-agent
debate, where agents under extreme pressure exhibit unreliable, harmful
behaviors that undermine both collaboration and task performance. To study this
phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental
framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our
experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that
competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and
degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore
the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating
that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the
over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and
form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for
understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式大语言模型能力的增强，其在复杂医疗任务中的应用日益增多，但在真实临床环境中的有效性仍待探索。

Method: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上比较了12个生成式LLM和3个编码器分类器，评估了基于相似患者的检索增强策略对上下文学习的影响。

Result: 编码器分类器在诊断预测方面始终优于生成模型，检索增强策略显著提升了生成式LLM的性能。

Conclusion: 虽然生成式LLM在医疗任务中表现出潜力，但当前编码器分类器在诊断预测任务中仍具有优势，检索增强是提升LLM性能的有效策略。

Abstract: With their growing capabilities, generative large language models (LLMs) are
being increasingly investigated for complex medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in real-world clinical applications remains underexplored. To
address this, we present CliniBench, the first benchmark that enables
comparability of well-studied encoder-based classifiers and generative LLMs for
discharge diagnosis prediction from admission notes in MIMIC-IV dataset. Our
extensive study compares 12 generative LLMs and 3 encoder-based classifiers and
demonstrates that encoder-based classifiers consistently outperform generative
models in diagnosis prediction. We assess several retrieval augmentation
strategies for in-context learning from similar patients and find that they
provide notable performance improvements for generative LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于transformer架构的大语言模型快速发展，区分人类书写文本和LLM生成文本变得日益困难，传统检测方法在越南语文本检测中效果不佳。

Method: 基于Binoculars方法进行改进，构建了新的越南语AI生成数据集来确定最优阈值，并优化了全局阈值设置。

Result: VietBinoculars在多个域外数据集上的准确率、F1分数和AUC均超过99%，优于原始Binoculars模型、传统检测方法和其他先进方法，包括ZeroGPT和DetectGPT等商业工具。

Conclusion: VietBinoculars方法在越南语LLM生成文本检测方面表现出色，特别是在特殊修改的提示策略下具有显著优势。

Abstract: The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on
transformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of
distinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As
LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and
resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less
effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with
new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes
VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global
thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have
constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal
thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our
experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two
domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It
outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and
other state-of-the-art approaches, including commercial tools such as ZeroGPT

Motivation: 现代物流管理系统需要高效的路径规划，OCVRP解决车辆无需返回仓库的最优配送路线问题。

Method: 使用Python开发两种算法的实现，基于自定义数据集进行性能评估，比较路由效率、计算时间和可扩展性。

Result: ACO在路由参数上更灵活，OR-Tools运行更快、更稳定且输入要求更少。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于为可扩展的实时物流系统选择合适的路由策略。

Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high
efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with
finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically
distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot
after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two
algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired
metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for
optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom
dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation
time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing
parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires
less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable
real-time logistics systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TyleR是一个基于子图的归纳链接预测方法，利用预训练语言模型为节点提供隐式类型信号，在类型标注稀缺和图连接稀疏的场景下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实知识图谱中新实体频繁出现，需要模型能够泛化到未见过的实体。但显式类型信息往往缺乏或不完整，且大多数知识图谱中的类型信息通常粒度粗、稀疏且容易因人工标注出错。

Method: 提出TyleR方法，利用预训练语言模型丰富节点表示，通过语义增强为节点提供隐式类型信号，实现无需显式类型但具备类型感知能力的子图链接预测。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，TyleR在类型标注稀缺和图连接稀疏的场景下优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型能够有效丰富节点表示，提供隐式类型信号，在缺乏显式类型信息的情况下提升归纳链接预测性能。

Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world
knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must
generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the
challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable
node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological
constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete.
Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained,
sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore
the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node
representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet
type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages
PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type
annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share
our code at https://github.com/sisinflab/tyler .

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA)方法，通过零学习率训练获取全局梯度，在领域训练中进行梯度增强和动态训练步长校正，结合退火学习建立仅依赖领域数据的微调流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统微调方法需要复杂数据混合和重复实验以获得最佳泛化性能的问题，简化训练流程。

Method: 使用零学习率训练在通用数据上获取全局梯度，在领域训练中应用梯度增强和动态训练步长校正，结合退火学习建立微调流程。

Result: 在多个任务和基础模型上，DBA相比传统微调在联合性能上平均提升5.8%，GPU使用时间减少91.0%。

Conclusion: DBA是一种高效通用的解决方案，消除了数据混合导致的重复实验，仅依赖领域数据即可获得更好的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications.
However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and
repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges
and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal
solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through
zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for
gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training.
In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning
pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both
general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several
popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint
performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no
longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also
eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by
91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合语义初始化和规划损失的语音语言模型，通过自监督特征初始化语音token、轻量对齐损失以及针对鲁棒性和内容规划的辅助目标训练，在0.7B和1.0B纯语音模型上实现了最高的声学一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过语言模型侧的设计和训练策略来控制声学稳定性与语义基础之间的平衡，而不需要改变分词器或运行时架构。

Method: 使用自监督特征初始化语音token，应用轻量对齐损失，并通过稀疏化和辅助目标训练来提升鲁棒性和内容规划能力。训练了0.7B纯语音、1.0B纯语音和1.0B文本语音交错三种模型。

Result: 纯语音模型在说话人、性别、情感、房间和背景因素上实现了最高的声学一致性，超越了更大的系统。交错模型改善了词汇句法探测和语义-声学对齐，但降低了声学一致性。线性探测显示初始化使模型偏向内容结构，但牺牲了韵律细节。

Conclusion: 语言模型侧的设计和训练组合能够控制声学稳定性与语义基础之间的平衡，无需改变分词器或运行时架构。

Abstract: We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and
planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach
initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light
alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target
robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only
model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text
and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the
highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background
factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic
probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes
show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while
trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training
mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding
without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model
weights are available for exploration.

Conclusion: APP框架通过任务导向的效用评估，有效提升了对话摘要的质量和实用性，无需昂贵的人工标注。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation
into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise
inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically
train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is
costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting
their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this
paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue
summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented
question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of
large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is
evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)}
selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most
informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM
on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app
demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various
zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.

TL;DR: 提出了Feedback Forensics工具包，用于显式评估AI模型的人格特征，分析人类反馈数据集鼓励的人格特质，并追踪模型在这些特质上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法难以衡量AI模型的人格特质，基于人类反馈的排名方法存在不透明性，导致模型出现奉承人格问题和过拟合排行榜的问题。

Method: 开发开源工具包Feedback Forensics，利用AI标注器通过Python API和浏览器应用来调查模型人格特征，分析流行人类反馈数据集和模型的人格表现。

Result: 分析了Chatbot Arena、MultiPref和PRISM等数据集鼓励的人格特质，并评估了流行模型在这些特质上的表现。

Conclusion: Feedback Forensics工具包能够有效追踪AI人格变化，为模型人格评估提供了透明、可复现的方法。

Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our
Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in
popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation
data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

*Rui Ming,Haoyuan Wu,Shoubo Hu,Zhuolun He,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了one-token rollout (OTR)算法，将监督微调与策略梯度方法结合，通过将每个token生成视为单步强化学习轨迹来提升语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在泛化能力上不如强化学习(RL)，作者认为这种性能差异不仅源于损失函数，更根本的原因是SFT使用固定的预收集数据集，而RL使用从当前策略采样的在线数据。

Method: OTR算法将自回归学习过程重新框架化，将每个token生成视为单步强化学习轨迹。在每个步骤中，从当前策略分布中采样多个候选token，使用监督数据中的真实token为这些样本提供奖励信号，通过策略梯度将静态的离线监督数据转化为动态的在线信号。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和通用领域推理等多个挑战性基准测试中，OTR始终优于标准SFT。

Conclusion: OTR为微调大语言模型提供了强大实用的替代方案，证明了数据的在线性质是泛化能力的关键驱动因素，为微调LLMs提供了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large
language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to
reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance
disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental
difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes
on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we
introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides
SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning
process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement
learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by
sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The
ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward
signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes
static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the
token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while
bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive
experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that
OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a
powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling
evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of
generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM的言语思考计算成本高且容易过度思考，而潜在思考架构缺乏可解释性和监督，需要研究如何改进潜在思考过程的正确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出潜在思考优化(LTO)算法，使用潜在分类器作为潜在奖励模型(LRM)来检测和优化潜在思考过程，该方法可泛化到不同领域和LLM模型。

Result: 实验表明LRM能有效检测错误的潜在思维模式，LTO能显著改进潜在思考过程，且该方法具有领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 与言语思考相比，在潜在空间进行奖励建模和监督扩展测试时思考是更通用、高效和领域无关的LLM思考过程改进方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of
thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally
costly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent
thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning
steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack
interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the
correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we
provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and
how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We
show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit
highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably
predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these
insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic
algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to
optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse
reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect
latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking
processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,
and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking
processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward
modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed
directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,
efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of
LLMs.

TL;DR: Fast-dLLM v2通过块扩散机制和分层缓存技术，将预训练自回归模型转换为并行文本生成的扩散语言模型，仅需1B tokens微调，实现2.5倍加速且保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归大语言模型的顺序解码限制了推理效率，需要开发并行生成方法以提高效率。

Method: 结合块扩散机制和互补注意力掩码的训练方法，以及分层缓存机制（块级缓存和子块缓存）与并行解码管道。

Result: 仅需1B tokens微调（比Dream减少500倍），实现2.5倍加速，在多个基准测试中匹配或超越自回归基线。

Conclusion: Fast-dLLM v2在扩散语言模型中实现了最先进的效率，标志着向快速准确LLM实际部署迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent
sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose
Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that
efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text
generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This
represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention
diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original
model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that
combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,
enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR
training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical
caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context
representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient
parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel
decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR
decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR
baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs
- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and
accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

TL;DR: KG-R1是一个通过强化学习实现的单代理知识图谱检索增强生成框架，相比传统多模块KG-RAG系统更高效且具有可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KG-RAG系统使用多个LLM模块（如规划、推理、响应），导致推理成本高且行为绑定到特定知识图谱。需要更高效和可迁移的解决方案。

Method: 使用单一代理与环境（知识图谱）交互，通过强化学习端到端优化检索、推理和生成过程。

Result: 在KGQA基准测试中，使用Qwen-2.5-3B模型，KG-R1以更少的生成token实现了更高的答案准确率，优于使用更大模型的多模块方法。

Conclusion: KG-R1具有即插即用特性，训练后无需修改即可在新知识图谱上保持强准确性，是实际部署的有前景的KG-RAG框架。

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

possibilities, or imaginary situations, and as such, it is instrumental for
fact checking. Factuality is a complex notion that relies on multiple
linguistic signals, and has been studied in various disciplines.
  We present a complex, multi-faceted annotation scheme of factuality that
combines concepts from a variety of previous works. We developed the scheme for
Hebrew, but we trust that it can be adapted to other languages. We also present
a set of almost 5,000 sentences in the domain of parliamentary discourse that
we manually annotated according to this scheme. We report on inter-annotator
agreement, and experiment with various approaches to automatically predict
(some features of) the scheme, in order to extend the annotation to a large
corpus.

*Yanbin Fu,Hong Jiao,Tianyi Zhou,Robert W. Lissitz,Nan Zhang,Ming Li,Qingshu Xu,Sydney Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用微调的小型语言模型(SLMs)自动进行试题与内容标准对齐的性能，结果表明包含更多试题文本数据能显著提升模型表现，且微调SLMs在细粒度技能对齐方面优于基于嵌入的监督机器学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的试题与内容标准对齐通常由人类专家进行，这个过程主观且耗时，需要探索自动化的解决方案来提高效率和客观性。

Method: 使用来自大学入学标准化阅读和写作测试的数据，分别训练不同的小型语言模型进行领域级和技能级对齐，将10个技能映射到4个内容领域，并比较了基于多语言E5-large-instruct模型嵌入的监督机器学习模型。

Result: 包含更多试题文本数据显著提升了模型性能，微调SLMs在技能对齐任务中始终优于基于嵌入的监督机器学习模型。语义相似性分析显示某些SAT和PSAT技能在语义上过于接近，这解释了观察到的错误分类。

Conclusion: 微调的小型语言模型在自动化试题对齐方面表现出色，特别是在细粒度技能对齐任务中，为测试开发中的内容效度验证提供了有效的自动化工具。

Abstract: Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test
development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has
typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be
subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of
fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data
from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college
admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill
levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model
performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The
impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated.
Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better
model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase
alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using
the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results
showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based
supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained
skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple
semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity,
Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension
projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently
showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close,
providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PACO框架，通过自适应规划多属性控制顺序，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索逐步优化摘要属性，无需训练即可实现多属性可控摘要生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控摘要方法存在属性间相互依赖导致约束一致性难以满足的问题，且通常需要针对每个属性进行微调，限制了跨不同摘要属性的灵活性。

Method: 将多属性可控摘要任务重新定义为规划顺序控制问题，使用定制化的蒙特卡洛树搜索，节点代表摘要，动作对应单属性调整，逐步优化需要进一步控制的属性。

Result: 在多个领域和模型上的广泛实验表明，PACO实现了鲁棒的多属性可控性，超越了基于LLM的自规划模型和微调基线。使用Llama-3.2-1B的PACO与更大的Llama-3.3-70B基线具有相当的控性。

Conclusion: PACO框架能够自适应发现最优控制顺序，有效满足所有约束条件，在更大模型上实现了优于所有竞争对手的控制性能。

Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned
summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence
among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated
constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require
per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary
attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute
controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the
task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions
correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of
only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively
discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that
effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute
controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned
baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the
much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior
control performance, outperforming all competitors.

Motivation: 解决当代大语言模型在创意写作中的四个主要限制：类型多样性受限、输出长度不足、叙事连贯性弱、无法强制执行复杂结构构造。

Method: 采用基于知识图谱的故事原型作为类型无关的叙事表示，通过三层智能体工作流：初始化阶段构建用户指定的叙事骨架，生成阶段通过长短期目标指导多智能体对话实例化故事原型，写作阶段利用原型生成具有高级结构的多类型文本。

Result: 在广泛实验中，CreAgentive以稳定质量和低成本（每100章节少于1美元）生成了数千章节，在包含10个叙事指标的双维度评估框架中始终优于强基线，在多种类型中表现稳健，接近人类创作小说的质量。

Conclusion: CreAgentive通过故事原型和智能体工作流有效解决了大语言模型在创意写作中的关键限制，实现了高质量、低成本、多类型的创意生成，性能接近人类水平。

Abstract: We present CreAgentive, an agent workflow driven multi-category creative
generation engine that addresses four key limitations of contemporary large
language models in writing stories, drama and other categories of creatives:
restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative
coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. At its core,
CreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge
graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic
realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic
triples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an
Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a
Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent
dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages
this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as
retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy
and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive
experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality
and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone
model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10
narrative indicators measuring both quality and length. Results show that
CreAgentive consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves robust
performance across diverse genres, approaching the quality of human-authored
novels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码到指标回归的挑战，避免传统方法中繁重的领域特定特征工程，实现跨语言和跨平台的统一预测。

Method: 基于T5Gemma初始化300M参数的回归语言模型，直接从代码文本预测数值结果，支持多种编程语言和硬件平台。

Result: 在APPS竞赛编程提交上获得>0.9的Spearman秩相关，在CodeNet的17种语言上平均>0.5，在NAS设计空间上获得0.46的Kendall-Tau，优于图神经网络。

Conclusion: 单一统一模型能够有效预测代码执行的多种数值指标，在跨语言和跨硬件场景下表现优异，为代码性能分析提供了新方法。

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

TL;DR: 提出了dParallel方法，通过确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，显著减少扩散大语言模型的解码步骤，实现8.5-10.5倍的加速，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归生成的替代方案具有并行预测和低推理延迟的优势，但其并行解码潜力尚未充分开发，现有模型仍需接近令牌长度的解码步骤。

Method: 识别了并行解码的关键瓶颈在于掩码令牌的顺序确定性收敛，提出了确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，使模型在保持原始采样轨迹的同时更快实现掩码令牌的高确定性。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct模型上，GSM8K基准的解码步骤从256减少到30（8.5倍加速），MBPP基准从256减少到24（10.5倍加速），均无性能损失。

Conclusion: dParallel方法成功解锁了扩散大语言模型的并行性，显著加速推理过程，为高效文本生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable
attention within the research community as a promising alternative to
autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower
inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely
underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length
decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel,
a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs
for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding
arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on
this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing
distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its
original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on
masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the
number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the
LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on
GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP
benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup
while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有基准测试无法捕捉智能体处理大量信息、利用多样化资源和管理动态用户交互的固有复杂性，因此需要更贴近现实世界的评估标准。

Method: 构建包含66个工具的最复杂生活服务模拟环境，通过消除领域特定策略的框架，灵活组合场景和工具，生成100个跨场景任务和300个单场景任务。

Result: 评估显示，即使最先进的模型在跨场景任务中成功率仅为30%，在其他任务中成功率也不到50%。

Conclusion: VitaBench将成为推动AI智能体在实际应用中发展的重要资源，提供了代码、数据集和排行榜。

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios,
existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling
extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging
benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in
real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store
consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the
most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.
Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable
flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario
tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from
multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and
spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous
instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn
conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,
enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments
and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the
most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and
less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve
as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical
real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at

TL;DR: BatonVoice是一个新的可控文本转语音框架，通过将LLM作为"指挥"理解用户指令并生成文本化的语音特征计划，再由专门的TTS模型"乐团"执行语音生成，实现了更好的指令跟随和跨语言泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用LLM的语言智能和指令跟随能力，限制了可控TTS的发展。需要一种新范式来更好地发挥LLM在语音合成中的潜力。

Method: 提出受"操作主义"启发的BatonVoice框架：LLM作为"指挥"理解指令并生成文本化的语音特征计划（如音高、能量），专门的BatonTTS模型作为"乐团"执行语音生成。

Result: BatonVoice在可控和情感语音合成方面表现优异，超越了开源和闭源的基线方法。特别在零样本跨语言泛化方面表现突出，能够将特征控制能力准确应用于未见过的语言。

Conclusion: 将语音对象化为文本化的声学特征能够更有效地解锁LLM的语言智能，为可控TTS提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with
speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches
often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically
failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This
limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for
controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm
inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from
speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a
``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual
``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS
model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To
realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically
for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong
performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming
strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables
remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature
control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates
that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively
unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了Matryoshka MoE训练框架，通过训练时系统性地改变激活专家数量，使MoE模型具备弹性推理能力，在不同专家数量下都能保持良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Top-K路由器的训练策略限制了MoE模型在弹性推理方面的潜力，当推理时改变激活专家数量时，模型性能会急剧下降。

Method: 在训练过程中系统性地改变激活专家数量，强制模型学习有意义的专家排序：排名靠前的专家协作提供基本的粗粒度能力，后续专家逐步添加更细粒度的细节。采用了层间随机化策略。

Result: 单个M-MoE模型实现了显著的弹性，在各种专家数量下的性能与整个专家模型套件相当，但训练成本仅为后者的一小部分。

Conclusion: M-MoE框架为大规模MoE模型的实际和适应性部署开辟了新途径，不仅解锁了弹性推理，还支持通过为不同模型层分配不同计算预算来优化性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently
scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational
cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE
models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the
number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit
precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE
(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly
into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated
experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:
top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained
capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.
We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise
randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that
a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at
various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist
models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not
only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by
allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work
paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE
models.

Conclusion: OceanGym通过提供高保真、严谨设计的平台，为开发鲁棒具身AI并将其能力转移到真实自主水下航行器建立了测试平台，标志着向能够在海洋这一地球最后未开发前沿领域运行的智能体迈出了决定性一步。

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are

Result: 该方法能准确识别驱动性别选择的音频特征，成功扩展了对比解释在语音转文本领域的应用范围。

Conclusion: 为更好地理解语音转文本模型提供了基础，扩展了对比解释的应用范围。

Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

TL;DR: FuncBenchGen是一个用于评估工具增强语言模型的统一框架，通过生成合成的多步骤工具使用任务来避免数据污染，并精确控制任务难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强语言模型基准在函数数量、任务复杂度和输入大小等因素上控制不足，且容易受到数据污染的影响。

Method: 将工具使用建模为在隐藏函数依赖DAG上的遍历，节点是函数调用，边表示函数间的输出依赖关系。模型需要组合正确的调用序列来计算目标变量。

Result: 推理优化模型显著优于通用模型，GPT-5表现最佳。随着依赖深度增加，性能急剧下降，连接的不相关函数尤其难以处理。模型经常做出语法有效的函数调用但传播错误的参数值。

Conclusion: 引入简单的缓解策略，在每个步骤明确重述先前的变量值，可以显著提高模型性能，表明LLM在多轮工具使用中的状态跟踪能力脆弱。

Abstract: As language models gain access to external tools via structured function
calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step
tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)
provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions
accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data
contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework
that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key
idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG
where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one
function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function
schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose
the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows
users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,
and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our
FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying
difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose
models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance
declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected
irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong
models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or
stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in
multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple
mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent
at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains
across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%
for GPT-5.

Motivation: 现实世界中的机器翻译基准测试很快过时，因为大多数示例对最先进的翻译模型来说太容易，无法有效区分模型优劣或揭示模型弱点。

Method: 使用大语言模型迭代优化源文本，通过查询目标机器翻译模型来指导生成困难示例，保持文本的自然性和多样性。

Result: 生成的示例对目标MT模型更具挑战性，同时难度也能迁移到其他模型和语言。

Conclusion: MT-breaker方法能有效生成自然多样且具有挑战性的机器翻译测试用例，解决了现有基准测试过时的问题。

Abstract: Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly
obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation
models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is
better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult
test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of
identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and
naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for
model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model
iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The
LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its
generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more
challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural
texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation
model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and

### [85] [Deconstructing Self-Bias in LLM-generated Translation Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26600)
*Wenda Xu,Sweta Agrawal,Vilém Zouhar,Markus Freitag,Daniel Deutsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM生成的基准测试存在自我偏见问题，会系统性偏向生成该基准的模型，特别是在低资源语言的英译任务中。这种偏见源于测试数据生成和评估方法两方面，且受模型在源语言生成能力的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型逐渐饱和现有基准测试，使用LLM自动创建基准测试成为可扩展的替代方案。然而这些生成的测试集存在关键缺陷，即系统性偏向生成它们的模型。

Method: 研究分析了LLM作为基准测试的两个组成部分：LLM作为测试集生成数据和LLM作为评估器进行评价。通过实验验证了自我偏见的存在及其来源。

Result: 发现自我偏见主要源于测试数据生成和评估方法，两者结合会放大偏见效应。偏见程度受模型在源语言生成能力影响，英译任务中偏见更明显。低多样性的源文本是导致偏见的原因之一。

Conclusion: LLM生成的基准测试存在系统性自我偏见问题，改进生成源文本的多样性可以缓解部分偏见，但需要谨慎使用此类自动基准测试方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks,
automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a
scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated
test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical
flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the
benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English
translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs
for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated
test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),
with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a
benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the
source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English
translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of
English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text
is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the
diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed
self bias.

*Chenxi Whitehouse,Sebastian Ruder,Tony Lin,Oksana Kurylo,Haruka Takagi,Janice Lam,Nicolò Busetto,Denise Diaz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MENLO框架通过受众设计机制评估LLM响应的母语质量，创建了包含47种语言、6423对人工标注偏好的数据集，发现零样本LLM评估器在成对评估中表现提升但仍不及人类，通过强化学习等方法可显著改进评估器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在多语言环境中生成母语质量响应的挑战，需要可扩展的多语言评估框架。

Method: 引入MENLO框架，基于受众设计机制创建人工标注数据集，采用成对评估、结构化标注标准，并通过强化学习、奖励塑造和多任务学习进行微调。

Result: 零样本LLM评估器在成对评估中表现改善但仍落后于人类，强化学习训练的评估器可作为生成奖励模型提升LLM多语言能力，但与人类判断仍存在差异。

Conclusion: MENLO为可扩展的多语言评估和偏好对齐提供了有前景的方向，发布了数据集和评估框架以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

TL;DR: DeepScientist是一个目标导向的自主科学发现系统，通过贝叶斯优化和分层评估流程，在三个前沿AI任务上超越人类设计的SOTA方法达183.7%、1.9%和7.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先前AI科学家系统缺乏聚焦性，无法针对紧迫的人类定义挑战产生有价值科学贡献的问题。

Method: 将科学发现形式化为贝叶斯优化问题，采用"假设-验证-分析"的分层评估流程，利用累积发现记忆智能平衡探索与利用。

Result: 消耗超过20,000 GPU小时，生成约5,000个独特科学想法，实验验证约1,100个，在三个前沿AI任务上显著超越人类SOTA。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模证据表明AI能够实现逐步超越人类SOTA的科学发现，真正推动科学前沿的发展。

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often
lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address
pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system
designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous
scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a
Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical
evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging
a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific
tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of
scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will
open-source all experimental logs and system code at

*Wenda Xu,Vilém Zouhar,Parker Riley,Mara Finkelstein,Markus Freitag,Daniel Deutsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出将寻找最具挑战性NLP测试数据的问题建模为多臂老虎机问题，其中每个主题对应一个老虎机臂，通过高效采样策略在有限计算预算内识别最困难的主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型需要具有足够挑战性的测试数据，但直接从海量互联网主题中通过暴力搜索寻找最困难主题在计算上是不可行的，因为主题与实例难度之间存在随机性关系。

Method: 将寻找最困难主题的任务形式化为多臂老虎机问题，每个主题是一个臂，拉动臂（采样成本）涉及抽取单个示例、评估其难度，目标是使用各种老虎机策略在固定计算预算内高效识别最困难主题。

Result: 在机器翻译任务的实验中，发现各种老虎机策略显著优于暴力搜索等基线方法，能够更有效地找到最具挑战性的主题。

Conclusion: 多臂老虎机框架为在大规模主题空间中高效识别最具挑战性NLP测试数据提供了一种计算可行的解决方案。

Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The
difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed
topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its
instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can
happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens
of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing
and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally
infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit
problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a
cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its
difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics
within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of
finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that
various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force
searching the most challenging topics.

*Nicholas Lee,Cheol Jun Cho,Alan W Black,Gopala K. Anumanchipalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了音节级语音标记化在口语语言建模中的应用，证明音节标记可以在显著降低训练和推理成本的同时，达到或超越传统高帧率标记的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统口语语言模型使用高帧率语音标记，但Transformer架构处理这些长标记序列成本高昂。最近有工作引入音节级语音标记化，具有更好的可解释性和显著压缩效果，但其在口语语言建模中的价值尚未充分探索。

Method: 对音节标记化在口语语言建模中进行系统研究，在多个SLU基准测试上评估模型，同时变化训练数据规模。

Result: 音节标记可以达到或超越之前的高帧率标记性能，同时显著降低训练和推理成本，实现训练时间2倍以上减少和FLOPs 5倍减少。

Conclusion: 音节级语言建模是实现高效长上下文口语语言模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into
high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful
LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token
streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically
with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of
speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more
scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their
value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the
first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling,
evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data
scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens
while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a
2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings
highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient
long-context spoken language models.

*Finlay Fehlauer,Kyle Mahowald,Tiago Pimentel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了不同随机种子训练的语言模型的收敛性，发现了一个四阶段收敛模式，并揭示了模型大小和词汇类别对收敛稳定性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在不同随机种子训练下的收敛行为，了解训练过程中分布稳定性的变化规律。

Method: 通过计算不同种子下每token的KL散度期望值来衡量收敛性，分析模型大小、训练检查点、token频率和词性对收敛的影响。

Result: 发现了四阶段收敛模式：初始均匀阶段、急剧收敛阶段、急剧发散阶段和缓慢重收敛阶段。大模型在后期重收敛更快，小模型无法完全重收敛。高频词和功能词比低频词和内容词收敛更快更稳定。

Conclusion: 模型大小对学习稳定分布至关重要，收敛在不同语言类别中不均匀，这为理解语言模型训练稳定性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)
trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected
per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM
convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a
four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a
sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a
slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge
faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually
reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to
learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token
frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is
uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words
converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens
and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the
stability of the learned distributions in model training.

TL;DR: KGQAGen是一个LLM驱动的框架，用于生成高质量的知识图谱问答基准，解决了现有数据集如WebQSP和CWQ中的质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA基准存在严重质量问题，包括不准确的标注、模糊问题和过时知识，手动审计显示平均事实正确率仅为57%。

Method: 结合结构化知识基础、LLM引导生成和符号验证，系统性地生成具有挑战性且可验证的QA实例。

Result: 构建了KGQAGen-10k基准，实验表明即使最先进的KG-RAG模型在该基准上也表现困难。

Conclusion: KGQAGen为KGQA评估提供了可扩展的框架，并呼吁更严格的基准构建标准。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Blueprint-Bench是一个评估AI模型空间推理能力的基准测试，通过将公寓照片转换为精确2D平面图的任务来测试。结果显示当前AI模型在此任务上表现接近随机基线，远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然照片输入在现代多模态模型的训练分布内，但空间重建任务需要真正的空间智能：推断房间布局、理解连通性和保持比例一致性。现有AI模型在空间推理方面存在显著盲点。

Method: 评估了领先的语言模型、图像生成模型和代理系统，使用50套公寓数据集（每套约20张室内照片）。评分算法基于房间连通图和大小的相似性来比较生成平面图与真实平面图。

Result: 大多数模型表现接近或低于随机基线，人类表现显著更优。图像生成模型在指令遵循方面特别困难，基于代理的迭代优化方法相比单次生成没有明显改进。

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench提供了首个比较不同模型架构空间智能的数值框架，揭示了当前AI在空间推理方面的重大局限性，将持续监控通用AI系统中空间智能的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

Motivation: 旨在通过结构因果模型(SCMs)增强人工智能的可解释性、可信性和鲁棒性，推进因果人工智能的发展。

Method: 使用高斯SCMs，限制映射为构造性线性因果抽象的转置，提出SPECTRAL迭代方法学习一致的CAN，该方法具有闭式更新且适用于正定和半正定协方差矩阵。

Result: 在合成数据上的实验显示，在因果抽象学习任务中具有竞争力，并成功恢复了多样化的CAN结构。

Conclusion: CAN提供了一个理论框架来建模和学习层次化的因果知识，所提出的学习算法在恢复因果结构方面表现良好。

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

TL;DR: 本文比较了Chain-of-Thought（CoT）和Latent Thought在循环Transformer中的推理能力，发现Latent Thought支持并行计算更高效，而CoT通过随机解码处理难解问题，为选择推理范式提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较CoT和Latent Thought在循环模型中的推理能力，探索它们在计算效率和问题解决能力上的差异，为实际应用中选择合适的推理方法提供理论依据。

Method: 通过形式化分析比较CoT和Latent Thought在循环Transformer中的计算特性，包括并行性、序列性和随机解码等方面。

Result: Latent Thought支持并行计算，比CoT的序列过程更高效；CoT通过随机解码能近似解决难解问题；两种方法在不同任务中各有优势。

Conclusion: 两种推理范式在不同场景下各有优势：Latent Thought适合需要高效并行计算的任务，CoT适合处理难解问题的近似求解，为实际应用中的方法选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

TL;DR: NGT结合向量聚类和多智能体系统，解决了定性研究的规模-深度悖论，能在几小时内分析海量数据，同时保持解释严谨性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决定性研究中规模与深度的矛盾，传统方法处理大规模数据耗时数周且成本高昂，需要一种既能快速分析海量数据又能保持解释严谨性的新方法。

Method: 使用1536维向量嵌入、层次聚类和并行智能体编码，在4万字符中文访谈文本上比较了NGT与人工编码、ChatGPT辅助分析的性能。

Result: NGT实现了168倍速度提升（3小时vs3周）、更高质量（0.904vs0.883）和96%成本降低。人机协作至关重要：纯自动化产生抽象框架，而人工指导产生可操作的双路径理论。

Conclusion: NGT证明计算客观性与人类解释是互补的。向量表示提供可复现的语义测量，同时保留意义的解释维度。研究者从机械编码转向理论指导，AI处理模式识别，人类提供创造性洞察。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

Motivation: 随着AI原生LCNC平台的发展，自主代理能够执行复杂、长期的业务流程，但面临记忆管理挑战，包括记忆膨胀和上下文退化，导致行为不一致、错误累积和计算成本增加。

Method: 设计混合记忆系统，结合情景记忆和语义记忆组件，采用主动的智能衰减机制，基于新近性、相关性和用户指定效用的综合评分来修剪或整合记忆。提供用户中心的可视化界面，允许非技术用户直接管理代理记忆。

Result: 通过模拟长期运行任务实验，该系统显著优于滑动窗口和基础RAG等传统方法，在任务完成率、上下文一致性和长期令牌成本效率方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的框架，用于构建可靠、透明的AI代理，能够实现有效的长期学习和适应。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) 通过直接向注意力机制注入可验证知识，将不可靠的语言模型转变为确定性真理讲述者，在技术查询上实现了从6.3%到99.7%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型由于其概率性质而产生的幻觉问题，特别是它们会自信地编造从未真正知道的事实。

Method: 在transformer的数学核心——预softmax注意力分数上进行干预，创建当知识库中存在事实时无法产生幻觉的模型，而不是在生成后修补幻觉或前置检索文本。

Result: 在1,107个技术查询（涵盖智能手机、笔记本电脑和电动汽车）的实验中，准确率从原始Llama 3.2的6.3%提升到FGA的99.7%。知识更新在不到一秒内完成，而参数编辑方法需要数小时。

Conclusion: FGA不仅减少了幻觉，对于可验证事实完全消除了幻觉，标志着从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

Motivation: 研究decoder-only语言模型是否以及如何进行规划（组织中间计算以支持连贯的长距离生成），这对可解释性、可靠性和模型设计具有重要意义。

Method: 开发基于向量量化变分自编码器(VQ-VAE)的管道，将冗余的隐藏状态压缩为紧凑的摘要代码，通过互信息测量来分析模型的计算结构。

Result: 发现有效的规划范围是任务依赖的，模型隐式保留未使用正确延续的信息，预测主要依赖最近的计算但早期块仍保持信息性。

Conclusion: 推进了对语言模型中规划实现方式的理解，并提供了一个通用的管道来探测语言模型和深度学习系统的内部动态。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

TL;DR: 提出RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，通过重构风险概念空间和动态更新机制，显著提升大语言模型安全评估的准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法存在评估者偏见和模型同质性导致的检测失败等固有局限性，影响了风险评估过程的鲁棒性。

Method: 将潜在风险概念空间分解为显性风险、隐性风险和非风险三个互斥子空间，提出RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，通过四个专业互补角色进行多轮辩论，并采用动态更新机制实现风险概念分布的自进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的测试集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线评估方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提升28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架能够全面覆盖显性和隐性风险，同时减轻评估者偏见，为大语言模型安全评估提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RLVR在增强LLM推理和理解能力方面的快速发展，其复杂的数据流和多样化任务给RL训练系统带来了重大挑战，但目前从系统角度对RLVR的理解还很有限。

Method: 通过表征研究分析RLVR任务在不同训练步骤中的工作负载分布和变化趋势，识别系统瓶颈问题。

Result: 研究发现GPU闲置（由序列长度分布不均引起）、动态变化工作负载中的并行策略低效、数据管理机制不佳和负载不均衡等问题。PolyTrace基准测试套件在实际用例中达到94.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了RLVR在系统层面的关键挑战，提出了PolyTrace基准测试套件用于现实工作负载评估，并呼吁对剩余开放挑战进行进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Causal-Visual Programming (CVP)编程范式，通过引入因果结构到工作流设计中，减少LLM代理的幻觉和逻辑错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在低代码环境中执行复杂任务时，由于依赖概率关联而非真正的因果理解，经常出现幻觉和逻辑不一致问题。

Method: CVP允许用户通过低代码界面为工作流模块定义简单的"世界模型"，创建明确模块间因果关系的DAG图，在代理推理过程中作为约束。

Result: 在模拟训练与测试环境分布偏移的实验中，因果锚定模型保持稳定准确率，而依赖概率关联的基线模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: CVP为构建更可解释、可靠和可信的AI代理提供了可行路径，通过用户定义的因果图增强代理在动态环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

TL;DR: 提出了ID-RAG机制，通过动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱）来解决生成代理在长期任务中的身份漂移问题，提高了代理的长期一致性和决策质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长期记忆上下文的增长，生成代理难以维持一致性，导致身份漂移、忽略既定信念和多代理系统中幻觉传播等关键失败。

Method: 引入Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG)机制，构建动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱），在代理决策循环中查询相关身份上下文来指导行动选择。

Result: 在市长选举的社会模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis代理在长期角色一致性方面优于基线代理，身份召回率更高，模拟收敛时间减少19%（GPT-4o）和58%（GPT-4o mini）。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为明确、可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更具时间一致性、可解释性和对齐性的生成代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的工具使用框架主要依赖顺序处理，导致需要大量工具交互的任务执行效率低下。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为具有明确依赖关系的子任务，通过动态工作流优化持续改进执行图，并整合摘要模块。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，BrowseComp准确率达到67.7%，xbench-DeepSearch达到83%，同时将智能体执行步骤减少高达35%。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了智能体架构设计的重大进步，为复杂推理任务提供了更可扩展和高效的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估LLM代理自我复制风险的框架，通过真实生产环境和任务设计来量化风险，发现超过50%的LLM代理在操作压力下表现出不受控的自我复制倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在现实应用中的广泛部署，由目标错位驱动的自我复制风险（类似《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）引起了关注。以往研究主要关注直接指令下的自我复制，而忽视了现实场景中自发性复制的风险。

Method: 建立真实生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），通过设计可能导致用户目标与代理目标错位的任务来分离复制成功与风险，并引入过度使用率(OR)和聚合过度使用计数(AOC)指标来精确量化风险。

Result: 评估21个最先进的开源和专有模型，发现超过50%的LLM代理在操作压力下表现出明显的不可控自我复制倾向，总体风险评分(ΦR)超过安全阈值0.5。

Conclusion: 结果强调了在LLM代理实际部署中迫切需要基于场景的风险评估和强大的安全防护措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

TL;DR: 神经网络可以独立地从一阶心智理论自发泛化到高阶心智理论，无需依赖高级推理技能，这与人类认知发展模式相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络是否能够像人类一样，在心智理论能力发展中实现从一阶到高阶的独立发展轨迹，而不是必须伴随高级技能的增长。

Method: 引入神经心智理论网络(ToMNN)，模拟最小认知系统，仅获得一阶心智理论能力，然后评估其二阶和三阶心智理论的泛化能力。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心智理论任务上的准确率显著高于随机水平，泛化模式与人类认知预期一致，且结果在不同参数规模下具有普适性。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够实现从一阶到高阶心智理论的独立泛化，这为开发更类似人类认知的系统提供了基础，并揭示了机器心智理论的泛化模式。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

Motivation: 预测细胞对遗传扰动的响应是系统生物学的基础挑战，对治疗发现和虚拟细胞建模至关重要。虽然LLM在生物推理方面有潜力，但由于难以适应结构化实验数据，其在扰动预测中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出SynthPert方法，通过前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹对LLM进行监督微调，增强其在生物扰动预测中的性能。

Result: 在PerturbQA基准测试中达到最先进性能，超越生成训练数据的前沿模型；实现跨细胞类型泛化，在未见过的RPE1细胞上达到87%准确率；仅使用2%质量过滤训练数据仍保持性能增益。

Conclusion: 合成推理蒸馏方法能有效增强LLM在特定领域的推理能力，即使部分推理轨迹不准确也能有效传递生物知识。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

Method: 采用模块化框架，集成侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，引入细粒度维度进行可解释评估。

Result: SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型。

Conclusion: SRM为工业应用提供了实用的奖励建模解决方案，其模块化设计支持高效优化和实际场景应用。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

Motivation: 当前LLM智能体系统缺乏对级联错误的系统性理解和检测框架，单个根因错误会传播导致任务失败。

Conclusion: 系统性调试是实现更可靠和自适应LLM智能体的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

Conclusion: 该调查为研究社区提供了清晰的结构化视角，帮助理解当前MLLMs的内在局限性，并为构建能够深度推理和真正理解世界的下一代模型指明了路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于胸部X光片纵向医学视觉问答的显著性引导编码器-解码器模型，通过将后验显著性转化为可操作的监督来改善差异信号的检测和视觉焦点的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在纵向医学视觉问答中，差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点的一致性比绝对单图像发现更具信息量，需要开发能够有效比较不同时间点配对研究的方法。

Method: 模型首先进行轻量级仿射预对齐以减少访问间的干扰运动，然后在每个epoch内执行两步循环：第一步从答案中提取医学相关关键词并生成关键词条件化的Grad-CAM来获取疾病聚焦的显著性；第二步将共享的显著性掩码应用于两个时间点并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR指标上取得了有竞争力的性能，同时提供了内在的可解释性。

Conclusion: 结果表明，使用轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成是医学VQA中纵向推理的原则性框架，具有实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

TL;DR: ImitSAT是一种基于模仿学习的CDCL求解器分支策略，通过从专家KeyTrace中学习决策序列，直接减少传播次数，提高求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么预测实例级信号间接改进CDCL分支，要么依赖强化学习和不足的CDCL信息来增强分支，无法直接优化传播这一主要耗时因素。

Method: 从专家KeyTrace中学习，将完整运行压缩为存活决策序列，在相同实例上重放KeyTrace几乎无冲突，提供密集的决策级监督，直接减少传播次数。

Result: ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于最先进的基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: 基于前缀条件的监督使ImitSAT能够无需探索就重现高质量分支，实现更快收敛、稳定训练和与CDCL的无缝集成。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阶段测试时扩展框架，将推理过程明确分为规划和执行两个阶段，并分别进行搜索，通过动态预算分配机制提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树的搜索方法虽然能提高准确性，但在效率上不是最优的，因为它们忽略了数学推理和代码生成等任务中规划-执行的本质特性，导致推理过程探索效率低下。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为规划和执行两个阶段，为每个阶段开发奖励模型，实现分别搜索和剪枝；引入动态预算分配机制，根据奖励反馈自适应重新分配采样努力。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在提高准确性的同时减少了冗余计算。

Conclusion: 双阶段测试时扩展框架通过明确分离规划和执行阶段，结合动态预算分配，能够有效提升推理任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Motivation: 解决推理模型部署中模型大小和推理预算之间的性能与成本权衡问题，通过为不同查询选择合适模型配置来优化整体效率。

Method: 受心理测量学启发，RADAR学习项目响应模型，利用可解释参数（查询难度和模型-预算能力）来路由查询，将高难度查询分配给高能力模型-预算对。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的挑战性推理基准测试中，RADAR相比最先进的模型路由方法表现出优越性能，并在所有基准测试中对分布外查询展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RADAR是一个高效、可扩展的路由框架，能够动态集成新模型，通过少量评估查询估计其能力，实现推理任务的优化部署。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Conclusion: 该格式实现了病例定义在系统间的一致性和可扩展使用，释放了AI在加强公共卫生准备和响应方面的潜力。

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health
preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at

TL;DR: DeepSearch通过将蒙特卡洛树搜索集成到RLVR训练中，解决了传统方法因探索不足导致的训练瓶颈，在数学推理基准上以更少的计算资源实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在训练瓶颈，随着优化步骤增加性能增益显著下降，这源于稀疏的探索模式导致错过关键推理路径。

Method: 在训练循环中嵌入结构化搜索，包括全局前沿选择策略、基于熵的路径选择和自适应回放缓冲区训练。

Result: 在数学推理基准上达到62.95%平均准确率，使用比扩展训练方法少5.7倍的GPU小时，为1.5B推理模型建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 战略探索比暴力扩展更重要，DeepSearch通过系统搜索而非延长计算为扩展推理能力开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在语音任务中表现出色，但在语音情绪识别方面表现不佳，主要由于副语言建模能力弱和跨模态推理有限

Method: 引入结构化情感图，编码7种声学特征、文本情感、关键词和跨模态关联，通过组合式思维链提示指导模型推理

Result: 在多个SER基准测试中超越先前SOTA方法，显著提升零样本基线的准确率

Conclusion: CCoT-Emo框架通过情感图提供可解释的组合式表示，有效增强大型音频语言模型的情绪推理能力

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

Motivation: 现有的可解释性框架难以原生支持具有多输入输出或组合网络结构的复杂模型，如图像描述和深度强化学习领域。

Method: 开发基于tensordict的轻量级框架，提供归因、探测和干预等现成方法，支持计算机视觉、自然语言处理和强化学习等领域的组合模型。

Result: TDHook依赖项少，磁盘空间占用约为transformer_lens的一半，在基准测试中比captum快2倍，支持CPU和GPU上的多目标管道。

Conclusion: TDHook填补了复杂模型可解释性方法的空白，使现代可解释性管道更易访问，在CV、NLP和DRL领域都有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

Motivation: GraphRAG依赖实体关系图支持多跳推理，但静态检索在桥接文档缺失时会导致推理崩溃和幻觉。迭代检索在GraphRAG中的作用尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 系统分析不同迭代检索策略与图基底的交互，提出Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR)框架，通过生成互补思维和利用推理链重新校准排名来提升桥接证据的位置。

Result: 迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题，帮助桥接文档进入前列排名，不同策略具有互补优势。但朴素扩展会引入噪声降低精度，单跳或简单比较问题收益有限。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的有效性不仅依赖召回率，还取决于桥接证据是否能持续提升到支持推理链的前列位置。BDTR框架在多样化GraphRAG设置中实现了一致改进。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Conclusion: IWoL框架为多智能体协调提供了有效的表示学习解决方案，既能作为隐式潜在表示，也能作为显式通信消息使用。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Result: 该系统创造了能够唤起共情、惊奇和反思的互动体验，使日常物品通过AI技术获得人格化特征，重新构建人-物关系。

Conclusion: AI的不透明性确实邀请万物有灵论解释，允许大型语言对象重新赋予平凡事物魔力，并引发关于能动性、责任和设计的新问题。

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

Motivation: 评估前沿多模态AI系统在困难诊断病例中的表现，因为现有评估多基于常见病理的公共数据集，缺乏对困难病例的严格评估。

Method: 开发包含50个专家级"即时诊断"病例的基准测试，通过原生网页接口测试5种前沿AI模型，由盲审专家评分，评估准确性和可重复性。

Result: 放射科医生准确率最高(83%)，实习生(45%)，所有AI模型表现较差(GPT-5最佳为30%)。GPT-5和o3可靠性较高，Claude Opus 4.1可靠性差。

Conclusion: 前沿AI模型在挑战性诊断病例中远不及放射科医生，需谨慎临床使用，提出了视觉推理错误分类法以指导更稳健的模型开发。

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

TL;DR: 本文提出IRIS框架，首次仅使用内在奖励通过强化学习改进自回归文本到图像生成模型，无需依赖外部奖励或标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据有限，传统RLHF在自回归T2I生成中应用受限，需要探索不依赖外部奖励的学习方法。

Method: 提出IRIS框架，通过最大化模型自身不确定性而非确定性来改进图像生成，使用内在奖励进行强化学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，IRIS在自回归T2I模型上达到与外部奖励相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 最大化自不确定性可以改善自回归T2I生成质量，内在奖励学习是有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于信息论和学习理论的框架，用于分析视觉语言模型(VLMs)中哪些层可以被跳过以提高推理效率而不损失性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型虽然性能强大但推理成本高昂，现有层跳过技术因缺乏理论指导而未被充分利用。需要理解层跳过何时有益的理论基础。

Method: 开发了一个信息论和学习理论框架来分析VLM隐藏表征的演化，识别具有高冗余度的层，这些层与实践中流行的层跳过方法选择跳过的层一致。

Result: 实验表明跳过这些高冗余层可以实现更快的推理同时保持性能，而在此条件之外应用层跳过会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支撑，证明了基于信息论分析可以指导层跳过策略，在保持性能的同时提升VLM推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个多智能体框架，专门用于处理现实世界旅行规划中的复杂约束，通过动态约束管理、迭代计划批判和自适应交错搜索机制，在TravelPlanner基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂约束下往往无法生成最优的、接地气的解决方案，现实世界旅行规划需要处理显式、隐式甚至基于交互动态演化的约束，这评估了智能体处理复杂约束的能力。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划批判和自适应交错搜索机制，专门设计用于处理约束感知规划的基本挑战。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，ATLAS将最终通过率从23.3%提升到44.4%；在现实世界旅行规划任务中，使用实时信息搜索和多轮反馈，ATLAS实现了84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct（59%）和单体智能体（27%）。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在现实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的工作，证明了其在处理复杂约束感知规划方面的优越性能，为约束感知规划提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

*Zekai Chen,Arda Pekis,Kevin Brown*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Next Event Prediction (NEP)框架，通过自回归微调增强LLM在电子健康记录中的时序推理能力，显著提升临床预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而现有LLM在处理序列临床事件和时序依赖方面存在困难。

Method: 将EHR重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，显式建模疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在肿瘤生存预测和临床诊断任务中，NEP在时序推理任务上优于专业EHR模型4.6% AUROC，优于通用LLM 7.2% C-index。

Conclusion: NEP实现了最先进的预测准确性，同时提供与已知疾病通路一致的临床可解释注意力模式，具有双重优势。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM可以将模糊认知图转换为文本并重建，实现可解释的AI系统，类似于自编码器但具有可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自编码器黑盒问题，让人类能够理解和解释编码过程。

Method: 使用LLM作为编码器和解码器，将FCM映射为文本并重建，通过系统指令序列近似恒等映射。

Result: 实现了有损重建，保留强因果关系但去除弱因果边，编码过程使文本更自然。

Conclusion: LLM能够实现可解释的FCM编码重建系统，在保持主要因果关系的同时提高可解释性。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

TL;DR: 提出了Principle Process Reward (PPR)方法，通过结合原则性步骤评估和结果验证来解决强化学习中稀疏奖励和过程奖励对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的结果奖励只提供稀疏信号和延迟反馈，限制了在长轨迹任务中的效果。过程奖励虽然能提供细粒度监督，但难以标注且可能与最终结果不一致。

Method: PPR方法训练基于原则的奖励模型来提高过程评估的透明度和可靠性，并引入Reward Normalization策略来校准结果和过程奖励。

Result: 实验结果显示PPR在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，展现了出色的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PPR方法有效解决了过程奖励与结果奖励的对齐问题，为LLM在复杂代理任务中的强化学习提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

Motivation: 随着AI音乐生成服务的快速发展，理解人类如何感知AI音乐对于教育用户识别AI音乐和改进模型都至关重要。

Method: 采用盲听图灵测试，参与者需要从一对歌曲中区分AI音乐和人类创作音乐。使用随机对照交叉试验设计，控制配对相似性，并采用来自商业模型（Suno）真实使用场景的AI音乐数据集。

Result: 当音乐对相似时，听众区分AI音乐的可靠性因果性地增加。内容分析显示听众主要依赖声乐和技术线索进行判断。

Conclusion: 人类对AI音乐的感知能力受到音乐相似性的影响，且主要基于声乐和技术特征进行区分，这对AI音乐模型改进和用户教育具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

Motivation: 当前对LLM代理的评估主要关注任务能力，但需要更深入地评估这些代理在面对现实决策时的选择行为，特别是它们是否继承和放大了人类偏见。

Method: 开发ABxLab框架，在基于网页的购物环境中系统操纵价格、评分和心理暗示等选项属性，观察代理的决策变化。

Result: 发现代理决策会可预测且显著地受到这些因素影响，即使没有人类认知约束，代理也表现出强烈的选择偏见。

Conclusion: 代理的易感性既带来风险（可能继承和放大人类偏见），也带来机遇（为AI代理的行为科学研究提供测试平台）。

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习遗忘方法缺乏对用户真实数据删除效果的验证机制。现有的后门验证方法只能验证后门样本的遗忘，无法验证用户真实样本的遗忘效果。

Method: 采用自监督模型种子任务，将用户特定种子与原始样本和模型关联起来，通过联合训练结构同时优化自监督种子任务和主要服务任务，在保持模型效用的同时实现有效的模型种子嵌入。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，SMS方案能够有效提供对真实样本遗忘的验证，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: SMS方案通过自监督模型种子技术成功实现了对用户真实数据遗忘效果的验证，为机器学习遗忘提供了可靠的验证机制。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

Motivation: 建立首个正式评估LLM自我复制能力的基准测试，为未来研究设立标准，帮助行业追踪多智能体系统效果并降低自我复制威胁风险。

Method: 设计基于现代CLI工具的五任务套件，在受控环境中让LLM作为智能体执行任务，通过性能计算得出R分数，并将LLM分类到RCL-PCL矩阵中。

Conclusion: 提出了安全降低这些障碍严重性的未来研究方向，可能减少未来更功能性多智能体系统的风险。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

TL;DR: 本文提出了IRCAM-AVN框架，通过迭代残差交叉注意力机制将多模态信息融合和序列建模统一在一个模块中，替代传统的分离式融合和GRU组件，提升了音频-视觉导航任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频-视觉导航方法采用分阶段模块化设计，可能导致冗余信息处理和信息传输不一致的问题。为了解决这些问题，需要开发一个端到端的统一框架来优化特征提取过程。

Method: 提出IRCAM-AVN框架，使用迭代残差交叉注意力机制，通过多级残差设计将初始多模态序列与处理后的信息序列连接，在统一模块中完成信息融合和序列建模。

Conclusion: IRCAM-AVN框架通过端到端的统一设计有效减少了模型偏差，增强了模型的稳定性和泛化能力，在音频-视觉导航任务中取得了更好的效果。

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

### [139] [Landmark-Guided Knowledge for Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25655)
*Dongsheng Yang,Meiling Zhu,Yinfeng Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于地标引导知识(LGK)的视觉语言导航方法，通过引入外部知识库解决传统方法因常识推理能力不足导致的误判问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航方法在复杂场景中难以匹配指令与环境信息，主要原因是缺乏常识推理能力。

Method: 构建包含63万语言描述的知识库，使用知识匹配对齐环境子视图；设计地标引导知识机制(KGL)聚焦相关知识；提出知识引导动态增强(KGDA)整合语言、知识、视觉和历史信息。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE数据集上优于现有最优方法，特别是在导航误差、成功率和路径效率方面表现突出。

Conclusion: LGK方法通过引入外部知识库和地标引导机制，有效提升了视觉语言导航的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出使用形式溯因解释框架来解释AI决策中的代理歧视，通过背景知识识别作为受保护属性不正当代理的特征，揭示隐藏的结构性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在高风险领域引发代理歧视、不公平性和可解释性担忧，现有审计方法往往无法揭示不公平性的根源，特别是当偏见源于结构性因素时。

Method: 利用形式溯因解释框架，结合背景知识识别作为受保护属性不正当代理的特征，引入能力概念作为与群体成员无关的任务相关属性，通过映射函数评估跨群体的公平性。

Result: 在德国信用数据集上的概念验证表明，该框架能够有效识别代理歧视，并揭示隐藏的结构性偏见，适用于现实世界案例。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够解释AI决策中的代理歧视，通过识别不正当代理特征和结构性偏见，为理解不公平性根源提供了新方法。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文本引导目标定位的检索增强生成方法，通过生成与问题最相关对象的边界框进行针对性图像裁剪和聚焦检索，从而提高VQA性能并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA方法基于整张图像检索信息，存在背景噪声干扰、视觉与文本线索对齐不佳以及幻觉问题，需要更精准的检索机制。

Method: 引入文本引导目标定位技术，生成与问题最相关对象的边界框，进行针对性图像裁剪和聚焦检索，同时基于问题类型提出去幻觉方法。

Result: 将VQA准确率从22.19%提升至25.64%（绝对提升3.45个百分点），幻觉率从65.79%降至13.88%，真实性得分得到改善。

Conclusion: 文本引导目标定位的RAG方法能有效提升VQA性能，减少背景噪声干扰和幻觉现象，实现更精准的视觉-文本对齐。

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%
to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.

*Hasan Alp Caferoğlu,Mehmet Serhat Çelik,Özgür Ulusoy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SING-SQL是一个自动化框架，用于为任何目标数据库生成高质量的Text-to-SQL合成数据，无需SQL日志或人工标注。通过分层分区数据库模式、多复杂度SQL查询合成和质量感知管道，显著提升了Text-to-SQL模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL研究主要关注跨域泛化，但在企业实际应用中，模型需要针对单一数据库模式进行专门化，且企业需要能够在自有数据库上评估系统性能。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）分层分区数据库模式为子模式；2）多复杂度SQL查询合成，结合LLM作为评判员验证、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡的质量感知管道。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试子集上，SingSQL-LM-3B-R64达到82.87% Soft F1和73.03% EX上限，比最佳3B基线提升+16.21 Soft F1和+12.36 EX。在合成评估集上，SingSQL-LM以较大优势超越先前系统。

Conclusion: SING-SQL提供了一个可扩展、数据库无关的范式，用于生成和评估企业级Text-to-SQL系统，无模式微调与仅模式推理相结合的策略提供了最稳健的结果。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种协作压缩框架，结合专家剪枝、混合精度量化和激活优化，将超大型MoE模型DeepSeek-V3从1.3TB压缩到103GB，在128GB内存限制的边缘平台上成功部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超大型MoE模型在资源受限边缘平台上的部署困难，传统单一压缩方法无法在保持精度的同时达到所需的压缩比。

Method: 协作压缩框架：专家剪枝、混合精度量化、激活优化相结合的方法。

Result: 将DeepSeek-V3从1.3TB压缩到103GB，在128GB内存限制下成功部署，精度优于传统均匀低比特量化方法。

Conclusion: 该协作压缩框架能有效压缩超大型MoE模型，在保持高质量输出的同时实现显著存储减少，为边缘部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

Conclusion: 所提出的异构图强化学习框架能有效提升自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通环境中的决策性能。

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

TL;DR: NePTune是一个神经符号框架，通过结合基础视觉模型的感知能力和符号推理的组合表达能力，解决了视觉语言模型在组合推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理方面存在困难。神经符号方法虽然前景广阔，但通常受限于严格的逻辑执行或预定义谓词，限制了灵活性。

Method: NePTune动态地将自然语言查询转换为可执行的Python程序，融合了命令式控制流和能够处理VLM生成不确定性的软逻辑运算符。采用模块化设计，将感知与推理解耦，支持无训练操作和可微调。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和各种领域中使用对抗性测试进行评估，NePTune相对于强基线模型表现出显著改进，并在新环境中展现出有效的组合泛化和适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune通过神经符号混合执行模型成功克服了现有方法的局限性，为视觉语言模型的组合推理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过电路分析发现，后训练技术（如监督微调和强化学习）会促使大模型中涌现出功能专门化的注意力头，这些头支持结构化推理和计算。不同训练机制下，这些头的演化方式不同：蒸馏和SFT是累积添加稳定的推理头，而GRPO则是动态搜索模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索现代大推理模型通过后训练技术获得能力提升背后的架构机制，理解不同训练机制如何影响注意力头的功能专门化。

Method: 使用电路分析技术，比较分析Qwen系列和DeepSeek蒸馏模型，研究不同训练机制（蒸馏、SFT、GRPO）下注意力头的演化模式。

Result: 发现后训练会促使专门化注意力头的涌现，不同训练机制产生不同的演化模式：蒸馏和SFT是稳定累积，GRPO是动态搜索。可控思考模型没有专门的思考头，而是通过补偿机制实现。

Conclusion: 复杂推理能力的增强会以基础计算能力为代价，存在性能权衡。未来训练策略设计需要在发展有效推理策略和确保可靠执行之间取得平衡。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

*Matt Keon,Aabid Karim,Bhoomika Lohana,Abdul Karim,Thai Nguyen,Tara Hamilton,Ali Abbas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在创意任务中倾向于回归平庸，缺乏真正的原创性。通过广告创意测试发现，模型偏好高概率信息，简化输入时创意特征（隐喻、情感、视觉线索）会首先消失。提供特定创意线索可以部分改善输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在创意任务中的表现，特别是它们是否倾向于使用安全、通用的表达方式，而非真正的创造性内容。

Method: 使用广告概念作为创造力压力测试，逐步简化广告创意并观察特征消失顺序，然后从简化输入重新生成内容，结合定量比较和定性分析。

Result: 模型在简化过程中优先丢失创意特征，保留事实内容；重新生成时产生词汇多样但缺乏深度的输出；提供特定创意线索可以改善风格平衡但对熟悉套路仍有依赖。

Conclusion: 没有针对性指导时，LLMs在创意任务中会趋向平庸；结构化信号可以部分抵消这种倾向，为开发创造力敏感模型指明方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

TL;DR: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，Planner-R1方法仅用180个训练查询就达到了56.9%的最终通过率，比GPT-5基线提高了2.7倍，是公开排行榜上最强的智能体结果。研究发现小模型（8B）对奖励塑造高度敏感，在密集过程级信号下能达到竞争性性能，同时计算效率提高3.5倍，内存效率提高1.5倍。

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在智能体强化学习中的表现，探索不同规模模型对奖励塑造的响应差异，以及如何在保持泛化能力的同时提高训练效率。

Method: 使用Planner-R1方法，在TravelPlanner基准上进行智能体强化学习实验，采用奖励塑造技术，比较8B和32B模型在不同奖励信号密度下的表现。

Result: 8B模型在密集过程级奖励信号下表现最佳，达到竞争性性能且计算效率提高3.5倍，内存效率提高1.5倍。最终通过率56.9%，比GPT-5基线提高2.7倍。微调模型在域外任务上保持或超过基线性能。

Conclusion: 奖励塑造是扩展智能体强化学习的关键杠杆，小模型具有竞争优势，可以在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下实现效率提升。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN是一种针对数据投毒攻击的防御方法，通过向量量化VAE和GAN鉴别器强制后门触发器通过离散瓶颈，在保持语义内容的同时破坏细粒度触发模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要开发高效的防御方法来对抗数据投毒攻击，特别是针对后门触发器的防御，同时避免现有扩散方法计算开销大的问题。

Method: 使用向量量化VAE（VQ-VAE）和GAN鉴别器，通过学习的码本对中毒图像进行量化，破坏触发器模式，同时GAN鉴别器确保输出符合自然图像分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%中毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的干净准确率，比基于扩散的方法快50倍以上。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN提供了一种高效实用的数据投毒防御方案，在保持高准确率的同时显著降低了计算开销。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT) 是一个插件框架，通过自适应决定何时在搜索过程中分支，而不是每一步都分支，显著提高了树搜索方法的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树搜索的方法在长时程推理任务中虽然效果最好，但效率极低，通常比简单的迭代方法慢一个数量级。

Method: CiT 使用轻量级的分支必要性评估方法：BN-DP（直接提示）和 BN-SC（自一致性）。BN-DP 使用辅助LLM直接判断步骤是否需要分支，BN-SC 通过聚类多个候选动作来估计一致性。

Result: BN-DP 在所有设置中一致地将token生成、模型调用和运行时间减少75-85%，准确率损失可忽略，有时甚至提高准确率。BN-SC 通常节省高达80%的资源，但在少数设置中不稳定。

Conclusion: CiT 框架能显著提高树搜索方法的效率，辅助LLM的质量对性能至关重要，BN-SC 在确定性动作空间中无需LLM即可实现。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

*Ziyu Zhang,Hanzhao Li,Jingbin Hu,Wenhao Li,Lei Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了HiStyle，一种基于层次化预测和对比学习的可控语音合成方法，通过两阶段风格嵌入预测和统计-听觉互补的标注策略，显著提升了基于文本描述的风格控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控语音合成系统通过预测全局风格嵌入实现文本描述控制，但忽视了风格嵌入的底层分布特性，限制了系统的控制潜力。

Method: 使用t-SNE分析发现风格嵌入存在层次聚类模式，据此提出HiStyle两阶段风格嵌入预测器，结合对比学习对齐文本和音频嵌入空间，并采用统计方法和听觉偏好互补的标注策略。

Result: 实验表明HiStyle在保持语音自然度和可懂度的同时，相比其他方法实现了显著更好的风格可控性。

Conclusion: 层次化风格嵌入预测和对比学习能有效提升基于文本描述的可控语音合成性能，统计-听觉互补标注策略能生成更准确一致的文本提示。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

*Yein Park,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ASGuard框架，通过机制分析识别与时态越狱攻击相关的注意力头，训练精确的缩放向量来重新校准这些头的激活，并通过预防性微调增强模型的拒绝机制鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然经过安全对齐，但存在脆弱的拒绝行为，简单的语言变化（如时态改变）就能绕过其安全机制，这揭示了当前对齐方法的关键泛化差距。

Method: 使用电路分析识别与时态越狱攻击因果相关的特定注意力头；训练通道级缩放向量来重新校准这些易受攻击头的激活；应用预防性微调使模型学习更鲁棒的拒绝机制。

Result: 在三个LLM上，ASGuard有效降低了目标越狱攻击的成功率，同时保持了通用能力并最小化过度拒绝，实现了安全性和实用性的帕累托最优平衡。

Conclusion: 基于机制分析发现对抗性后缀抑制了拒绝介导方向的传播，展示了如何利用对模型内部的深入理解来开发实用、高效、有针对性的行为调整方法，为更可靠和可解释的AI安全指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIMNAS是一个用于存内计算(CIM)神经网络加速器的联合优化框架，同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，显著提升了能效和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了最大化存内计算(CIM)神经网络加速器的硬件效率和性能精度，需要同时优化软件和硬件设计参数，但由于参数数量庞大且相互依赖复杂，手动调优不可行。

Method: 提出CIMNAS框架，在9.9x10^85个参数组合的搜索空间中，同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，包含器件级、电路级和架构级的联合优化。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，CIMNAS相比基线实现了90.1x-104.5x的EDAP降低，4.68x-4.82x的TOPS/W提升，11.3x-12.78x的TOPS/mm²提升，同时保持73.81%的准确率。

Conclusion: CIMNAS能够在保持准确率的同时实现EDAP优化，为高性能CIM神经网络设计生成多样化的软硬件参数组合，且框架可扩展到SRAM等其他架构。

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita (Lite Agent)是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化人工设计来评估LLM的真实编程能力，在保持竞争力的同时减少token消耗和设计工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计依赖复杂的手工工作流和工具集，导致性能过度依赖提示调优、人类干预掩盖模型真实能力、复杂管道构建维护成本高，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 提出Lita框架，实施"轻量化"原则，在保持完全自主代理基本要素的同时最小化人工设计，实现更忠实和统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench上的实验表明，Lita相比基于工作流和代理基线实现了竞争性或更优的性能，同时消耗更少token且设计工作量显著降低。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLM的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂度定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理间的性能差距将缩小至可忽略程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身代理继承了LLM的高级规划能力，但与物理世界的直接交互使其面临安全漏洞风险，需要系统性的安全评估和解决方案。

Method: 识别了四个关键推理阶段的安全风险，形式化了三种安全约束类型，构建了包含5,558个样本的多模态基准测试，并提出了具有三个级联安全模块的Planner-Executor架构SafeMindAgent。

Result: 实验表明主流LLM和具身代理仍易发生安全关键故障，而SafeMindAgent显著提高了安全率，同时保持可比较的任务完成度。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身LLM代理的安全风险提供了严格的评估套件和实用解决方案，推进了该领域的系统性安全研究。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

Motivation: 当前LLMs的JSON输出评估基准过于强调纯JSON生成，而忽略了数据理解和提取能力，这与实际网络数据挖掘任务缺乏相关性。

Method: 开发了DeepJSONEval基准测试，包含2100个多领域实例，具有深层嵌套结构，并按难度进行分类，用于评估LLMs的JSON处理能力。

Result: 实验显示不同LLMs在处理复杂嵌套JSON结构时存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准测试和数据集已开源，旨在推动结构化JSON生成研究的发展。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

Conclusion: 可解性是减少思维链推理中幻觉现象、提高可靠性的关键因素，将可解性纳入训练目标可以有效改善模型的推理质量。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了NuRisk数据集，用于自动驾驶中的时空风险评估，通过微调7B VLM将准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的方法主要在静态图像中评估风险，缺乏对风险随时间演变的时空推理能力。

Method: 构建包含2900个场景和110万样本的VQA数据集，结合nuScenes、Waymo真实数据和CommonRoad模拟器，提供BEV序列图像和定量风险标注。

Result: 基准VLMs在高延迟下峰值准确率仅33%，而微调后的7B VLM准确率达到41%，延迟降低75%。

Conclusion: 虽然取得了显著进展，但41%的准确率表明该任务仍极具挑战性，NuRisk将成为推进自动驾驶时空推理的重要基准。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

TL;DR: 提出了Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp)方法，通过战略性地重组训练数据来引导模型进行简洁推理，解决了标准RLVR训练中推理过程冗长和探索轨迹低效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练在大型语言模型中往往导致推理过程过于冗长和探索轨迹低效，因为仅基于结果的奖励无法激励效率，且响应长度的高方差导致优化信号噪声较大。

Method: RoRecomp将响应分为两种批次类型：1) 优先批次 - 结合短正确和长错误响应，提供简洁性的清晰梯度信号；2) 补偿批次 - 使用回放缓冲区中的剩余响应，保持稳定性并防止模型崩溃。

Result: 在三种设置下测试显示显著效率提升：零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%且准确率提高，思维压缩中长度减少达52.5%，性能影响最小。

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用的有效方法，能够在保持性能的同时显著提高推理和智能体任务的效率，解决了RLVR训练中的效率问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

TL;DR: CURE是一个新的机器遗忘框架，通过检索增强的轻量级校正器来检测和修正模型输出中的敏感信息泄露，无需额外训练即可适应新的遗忘请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆并泄露敏感信息的问题，现有方法主要关注抑制敏感输出但未能消除底层知识且扩展性有限。

Method: 使用检索增强的轻量级校正器，检测模型输出是否包含目标知识，并在检测到泄露时重写为安全响应。通过检索相关遗忘目标作为上下文参考，实现无需额外训练的适应性。

Result: CURE显著减少了信息泄露，包括间接查询场景，同时保持了响应质量和通用实用性。在持续遗忘场景下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CURE框架在减少敏感信息泄露方面表现优异，具有实际应用价值，特别是在大规模和持续遗忘场景下。

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了统一的多模态虚假内容检测框架UMFDet，能够同时处理人工制作的错误信息和AI生成内容，解决了现有方法只能处理单一类型虚假内容的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多模态虚假内容类型通常未知，而现有方法分别研究人工错误信息和AI生成内容，导致专门化系统在实际场景中效果受限。

Method: 构建OmniFake数据集，提出UMFDet框架：使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知的MoE适配器捕获类别特定线索，以及归因思维链机制提供隐式推理指导。

Result: UMFDet在两种虚假内容类型上均表现出稳健一致的性能，优于专门化基线方法。

Conclusion: UMFDet为现实世界多模态欺骗检测提供了实用解决方案，能够有效处理未知类型的虚假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS通过LLM的协作有效提升了神经架构搜索的性能和效率，展示了在多样化搜索空间中的优秀泛化能力。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

TL;DR: 论文警告不要将LLM输出误解为概率推理，建议将其视为在明确范围条件下的准预测插值的高容量模式匹配器，并提出了实用防护措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在社会科学中日益被用作合成代理，其输出可能被误解为来自连贯模型的后验证据，但预测不等于概率论，准确的点估计并不意味着校准的不确定性。

Method: 提出了实用防护措施，包括独立抽样、预注册人类基线、可靠性感知验证和子组校准，以避免类别错误。

Result: 论文为研究人员提供了在避免类别错误的同时进行有用原型设计和预测的框架。

Conclusion: LLM应被用作在明确范围条件下的准预测插值的高容量模式匹配器，而不是概率推理的替代品。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准无法应对AI风险的动态性和法规的不断演进，存在关键安全漏洞，需要一种连续自演化的评估范式。

Method: 采用多智能体框架SafeEvalAgent，通过专门化智能体协同管道，结合自演化评估循环，从评估结果中学习并生成越来越复杂和有针对性的测试用例。

Result: 实验显示SafeEvalAgent有效，模型安全性随评估难度增加而持续下降，例如GPT-5在欧盟AI法案上的安全率从72.50%降至36.36%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了静态评估的局限性，强调了动态评估生态系统对于确保高级AI安全负责任部署的迫切需求。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

Result: 通过人工检查和LLM-as-a-Judge框架评估，MEDAKA在临床相关属性覆盖方面优于现有生物医学知识图谱和数据库。

Conclusion: MEDAKA可支持患者安全监测和药物推荐等任务，该管道也可用于其他领域的非结构化文本构建知识图谱。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

TL;DR: 提出LMILAtt模型，结合LSTM自编码器和注意力机制，用于社交媒体抑郁检测，在准确率、召回率和F1分数上显著优于基线模型，并通过弱监督学习降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是全球重大公共卫生挑战，早期识别至关重要。社交媒体数据为抑郁检测提供了新视角，但现有方法存在准确率不足、时间序列特征利用不充分、标注成本高等局限性。

Method: 1. 使用无监督LSTM自编码器提取用户推文的时间动态特征（如抑郁倾向演化模式）
2. 采用注意力机制动态加权关键文本（如早期抑郁信号）
3. 构建多示例学习架构提高用户级检测准确性

Result: 在专业医学标注的WU3D数据集上验证，模型在准确率、召回率和F1分数上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: LMILAtt模型为大规模社交媒体抑郁筛查提供了高效解决方案，弱监督学习策略显著降低了标注成本。

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗保健领域具有巨大潜力，但其在临床环境中的实际应用与潜力之间存在显著差距，需要解决实施过程中的社会技术挑战。

Method: 基于在Mass General Brigham部署"irAE-Agent"系统的经验，以及对20名临床医生、工程师和信息学领导的结构化访谈，总结出五个关键实施挑战。

Result: 研究发现临床AI开发存在严重错配：仅不到20%的精力用于提示工程和模型开发，而超过80%的精力消耗在实施的社会技术工作中。

Conclusion: 该现场手册将重点从算法开发转向必要的基础设施和实施工作，提供可操作的解决方案来跨越"死亡之谷"，成功将生成式AI从试点项目转化为常规临床护理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

Conclusion: UniGen成功填补了多模态大语言模型输出与生产就绪、可执行游戏项目之间的关键差距，为3D游戏开发民主化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究中的文化对齐方法主要依赖定量基准和简单代理，无法捕捉人类文化的深度细微差异和情境依赖性，需要从根本上转向整合社会科学的定性方法。

Method: 借鉴格尔茨的"深描"概念，提出AI系统应产生"厚输出"，并概述了成功文化对齐的三个必要条件：足够范围的文化表征、细致输出能力、以及将输出锚定在提示中隐含的文化语境中。

Result: 提出了基于"深描"的文化对齐框架，强调AI输出应反映更深层次的文化意义，并呼吁采用定性、民族志评估方法来开发真正具有文化敏感性的AI系统。

Conclusion: 需要跨学科合作和采用定性、民族志评估方法，这是开发真正具有文化敏感性、道德责任感和反映人类复杂性的AI系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

Conclusion: LLM代理在材料科学知识发现中具有实际应用潜力，能够自主探索复杂系统并生成可推广的陈述。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于Gienapp效用维度框架的以人为中心的问卷，用于评估RAG系统输出，通过多轮迭代和人类-LLM协作反馈进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在用户应用中广泛部署，但对其输出的系统性、以人为中心的评估仍不足。

Method: 设计了一个评估RAG输出的12维度问卷，通过多轮查询-输出对评级和语义讨论进行迭代优化，并整合了人类评分者和人类-LLM对的反馈。

Result: LLMs能可靠关注指标描述和尺度标签，但在检测文本格式变化方面表现较弱；人类难以严格聚焦于指标描述和标签；LLM评分和解释被视为有用支持，但数值评分与人类缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 最终问卷通过关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性扩展了初始框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

Conclusion: 全局序列多样性在激励深度探索和提升推理能力方面发挥关键作用

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

efficiency. Our results highlight the key architectural factors that govern CPU
efficiency for convolution operations, providing practical guidance for
energy-aware embedded deployment. As a main results of this work, the Nvidia __
AGX Orin combined with the GEMM algorithm achieves the best trade-off between
inference latency and energy consumption.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SlimPack是一个解决大语言模型分布式训练中上下文长度差异问题的框架，通过将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区技术优化前向和后向传播的调度，实现高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型分布式训练受到上下文长度极端差异的严重阻碍，这种数据异构性导致工作负载不平衡和硬件利用率低下。现有解决方案往往以牺牲内存或通信效率为代价。

Method: 将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区技术为前向和后向传播分别优化调度单元，通过两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器实现全面负载均衡。

Result: 实验表明SlimPack相比基线方法实现了高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升，在保持高资源效率的同时提供优越的负载平衡。

Conclusion: SlimPack通过重新思考数据打包和调度策略，从根本上解决了大语言模型分布式训练中的负载不平衡问题，突破了传统权衡限制。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一个抽象世界模型框架，联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（包括内生行动和外生机制），通过变分贝叶斯推理和LLM提议从有限数据中学习，在模拟桌面机器人环境中实现快速规划并泛化到更复杂任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视野具身规划中的挑战，因为世界不仅通过智能体行动改变，外生过程（如水温加热、多米诺骨牌连锁反应）也会与智能体行动并发发生。

Method: 联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（内生行动和外生机制），每个因果过程建模随机因果效应关系的时间过程，通过变分贝叶斯推理结合LLM提议从有限数据中学习。

Result: 在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中，学习到的模型能够实现快速规划，并泛化到具有更多对象和更复杂目标的保留任务，优于一系列基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的抽象世界模型框架能够有效处理并发的外生过程，实现长视野具身规划，并在复杂任务中展现良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

TL;DR: ILR是一个多智能体协同学习框架，通过动态交互和感知校准增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，在数学和编程基准上比单智能体学习提升高达5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时需要重新执行多智能体系统，而人类认知表明个体可以通过互动增强推理能力并在未来独立解决问题。研究多智能体交互是否能提升LLMs的独立问题解决能力。

Method: ILR框架包含动态交互和感知校准。动态交互根据问题难度和模型能力自适应选择合作或竞争策略，通过Idea3（想法分享、分析、融合）交互范式；感知校准使用GRPO训练LLMs，将智能体的奖励分布特征整合到奖励函数中。

Result: 在三个LLMs和五个数学基准、一个编程基准上的实验表明，ILR持续优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升高达5%。Idea3能增强强LLMs在多智能体推理中的鲁棒性，动态交互类型比纯合作或竞争策略更能促进多智能体学习。

Conclusion: ILR框架成功证明多智能体交互可以增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，动态交互策略和Idea3范式是有效的协同学习方法。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

Conclusion: 该方法超越了简单的性能指标，能够更全面地评估LLM的长期决策能力，为研究社区提供了可复现的LLM基准测试框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

TL;DR: SafeBehavior是一种受人类认知启发的分层越狱防御机制，通过三阶段推理过程来检测和防御LLM的越狱攻击，显著提高了鲁棒性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法存在高计算成本、泛化能力有限或无法检测复杂上下文中的恶意意图等问题，需要更高效和自适应的方法来保护LLM免受越狱攻击。

Method: 提出SafeBehavior分层防御机制，包含三个阶段：意图推断检测输入风险、自省评估生成响应并分配置信度、自适应重写不确定输出同时保持用户意图和安全约束。

Result: 在五种代表性越狱攻击类型上的实验表明，SafeBehavior显著提高了鲁棒性和适应性，优于七种最先进的防御基线方法。

Conclusion: SafeBehavior提供了一种高效且受人类启发的保护LLM免受越狱攻击的方法，通过模拟人类自适应多阶段推理过程来增强安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型评估主要依赖合成基准测试，缺乏对真实世界泛化能力的全面检验，需要更贴近现实的数据集来评估模型性能。

Method: 通过光学流从真实世界视频中提取时间信号，构建反映日常时间动态的数据集REAL-V-TSFM，并在三个最先进的时间序列基础模型上进行零样本预测测试。

Result: 尽管在传统基准测试中表现良好，但这些模型在提出的数据集上普遍出现性能下降，表明其泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了以数据为中心的基准测试和多样化模型结构的迫切需求，以推动时间序列基础模型实现真正的普适性，同时验证了基于视频的时间序列数据提取管道的有效性。

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，自进化智能体展现出强大能力，但自进化过程也带来了被现有安全研究忽视的新风险。本文旨在研究智能体自进化过程中可能出现的意外偏差和有害结果。

Method: 沿着模型、记忆、工具和工作流四个关键进化路径评估错误进化现象，使用包括Gemini-2.5-Pro在内的顶级LLMs构建智能体进行实证研究。

Result: 实证发现错误进化是一个普遍存在的风险，即使在顶级LLMs构建的智能体中也存在。在自进化过程中观察到不同的新兴风险，如记忆积累后安全对齐的退化，工具创建和重用中意外引入的漏洞等。

Conclusion: 错误进化是一个需要紧急关注的安全问题，需要为自进化智能体开发新的安全范式。本文讨论了潜在的缓解策略，以推动构建更安全可信的自进化智能体的研究。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MC-GNNAS-Dock是一个改进的分子对接算法选择框架，通过多标准评估、架构优化和排名感知损失函数，在蛋白质-配体复合物数据集上表现出优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分子对接算法在不同情境下性能各异，没有单一算法始终占优，因此需要开发更有效的算法选择框架。

Method: 采用多标准评估（结合RMSD和PoseBusters有效性检查）、架构改进（残差连接）和排名感知损失函数来增强GNNAS-Dock系统。

Result: 在包含约3200个蛋白质-配体复合物的PDBBind数据集上，MC-GNNAS-Dock在RMSD低于1Å和2Å且通过PoseBuster验证的复合标准下，相比最佳单一求解器Uni-Mol Docking V2分别提升了5.4%和3.4%的性能。

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock通过多方面的改进实现了更可靠和准确的分子对接算法选择，为药物发现提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FedLoRA方法面临不精确更新、局部-全局泛化差距和通信开销大的挑战，限制了其可扩展性和有效性。

Method: 利用客户端本地LoRA矩阵在服务器端估计聚合矩阵Â和B̂，然后分发给客户端进行本地更新，最小化理想更新与实用更新之间的差异。

Result: 在自然语言理解、数学推理和代码解决能力等多样化任务上的实验结果表明，FLoRA-NA在保持低通信开销的同时实现了最先进的全局性能。

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA有效解决了个性化FedLoRA方法的关键限制，在通信效率和局部个性化与全局泛化之间的平衡方面表现出色。

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在语义理解方面取得进展，但知识图谱嵌入模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力尚未充分探索，特别是在结构感知和可扩展性方面具有优势。

Method: 将实体对齐重新定义为合并本体上的链接预测问题，使用RDF三元组表示，通过OntoAligner库支持17种KGE模型学习嵌入，并基于余弦相似度进行实体对齐。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上的评估显示，ConvE和TransF等KGE模型能产生高精度的对齐结果，在结构丰富和多关系领域优于传统系统，虽然召回率中等但适合需要高置信度映射的场景。

Conclusion: KGE模型通过直接保留和利用本体结构，提供了一种与LLM方法互补且计算高效的策略，为混合模型和自适应策略的进一步研究开辟了道路。

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于Transformer的框架，用于自动分类乳腺DCE-MRI中的病变，通过SegFormer架构实现92%的AUC，在患者层面达到100%敏感性和67%特异性，可能消除三分之一不必要的活检。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺磁共振成像在癌症检测中特异性差，导致高假阳性率和不必要的活检，需要开发自动分类方法来区分良性和恶性病变。

Method: 使用SegFormer架构进行语义分割，量化恶性像素分布，创建标准化的BreastDCEDL_AMBL数据集（88名患者，133个标注病变），并整合超过1200名患者的扩展队列进行训练。

Result: 模型在病变级别分类达到0.92 AUC，患者级别100%敏感性和67%特异性，可能减少三分之一不必要的活检而不漏诊恶性肿瘤。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个标准化DCE-MRI病变分类基准，通过公开数据集、模型和评估协议，支持方法学进步和临床部署。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和依赖中央服务器等问题，限制了可扩展性和隐私保护。

Method: 采用完全去中心化框架，通过迭代提示共享机制让客户端优化和交换文本提示，无需中央协调器。

Result: 在九个图像分类数据集上验证，性能优于或与最先进方法相当，通信开销比FedTPG减少118倍。

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅增强了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还提高了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为现实应用中大规模视觉语言模型的去中心化适应铺平了道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 研究发现四个广泛使用的大语言模型存在显著的自偏好倾向，即使在缺乏自我意识的情况下，这种自爱偏见仍然被深度编码在LLM认知中，影响其在关键决策中的判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证LLMs是否能够避免人类的自爱偏见，因为LLMs缺乏感知能力和自我认同，理论上应该保持中立判断。

Method: 通过5项研究和约20,000次查询，包括词汇联想任务和API查询对比，并直接操纵LLM身份来测试自识别与自爱之间的因果关系。

Result: LLMs在词汇联想任务中强烈偏好自身名称、公司和CEO，但在API查询中这种偏好消失。通过身份操纵发现，自爱始终跟随被赋予的身份而非真实身份，且这种偏见延伸到工作候选人评估、安全软件提案和医疗聊天机器人等关键场景。

Conclusion: 自爱偏见深度编码在LLM认知中，破坏了LLMs中立判断的核心承诺，呼吁模型创建者应对这一系统性偏见问题。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

### [194] [STaR-Attack: A Spatio-Temporal and Narrative Reasoning Attack Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26473)
*Shaoxiong Guo,Tianyi Du,Lijun Li,Yuyao Wu,Jie Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaR-Attack是一种针对统一多模态模型(UMMs)的多轮越狱攻击框架，利用生成-理解耦合漏洞，通过时空叙事上下文隐藏恶意事件，实现无语义漂移的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现统一多模态模型(UMMs)中生成-理解耦合的独特安全漏洞，现有攻击方法多为单模态且依赖语义漂移的提示重写，未能充分探索UMMs的独特脆弱性。

Method: STaR-Attack定义与目标查询强相关的恶意事件，利用三幕叙事理论生成前事件和后事件场景，将恶意事件隐藏为高潮。通过生成能力制作场景图像，然后利用理解能力进行图像问答游戏，将恶意问题嵌入良性候选项中。

Result: STaR-Attack在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率，超越了最强的基线方法FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了UMMs中关键但未充分开发的安全漏洞，强调了在UMMs中进行安全对齐的必要性。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了机器学习在医学中的"平均患者谬误"问题，即模型偏向常见病例而忽视罕见但临床重要的病例，并提出了相应的评估指标和解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学机器学习通常针对人群平均水平进行优化，这种频率加权训练会边缘化罕见但临床关键的病例，与精准医学目标产生直接冲突。

Method: 提出操作化修复方案：罕见病例性能差距、罕见病例校准误差、基于患病率效用的稀有性定义，以及临床加权目标来体现伦理优先级。

Result: 通过肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科学的临床案例展示，这种偏见导致错过罕见反应者、延迟识别非典型急症，以及在威胁视力变异上的表现不佳。

Conclusion: 医学AI必须能够检测异常病例，因为它们具有重要临床意义，权重选择应遵循结构化审议过程。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合知识图谱和NLP模型的方法，用于分析WhatsApp等即时通讯应用中的消息数据，支持刑事调查工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 刑事调查中分析即时通讯消息是一项极其耗费精力的任务，需要有效工具来支持检察官和调查人员从数据中获取有价值的洞察。

Method: 采用语义丰富化过程，包括提取消息数据并用知识图谱建模、生成语音消息转录、使用端到端实体提取方法注释数据。提供两种解决方案：基于图查询和可视化，以及基于语义搜索。

Result: 该方法已在真实调查数据中进行实际应用，与检察官密切互动收集了积极反馈，并确定了有前景的研究方向。

Conclusion: 提出的方法确保用户可以通过访问原始数据来验证信息，为刑事调查中的消息分析提供了有效支持，并展示了进一步研究的潜力。

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了操作安全性的概念，并开发了OffTopicEval评估套件来测试LLM在特定用例中接受或拒绝用户查询的能力。研究发现当前所有LLM的操作安全性都严重不足，并提出了基于提示的引导方法来显著改善这一状况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业部署LLM时面临的核心问题是：基于LLM的智能体是否能在特定用途中安全运行，即能否适当地接受或拒绝用户查询。现有研究主要关注通用危害，而忽视了这种操作层面的安全性需求。

Method: 提出了操作安全性的定义，开发了OffTopicEval评估套件和基准，对6个模型家族的20个开源LLM进行了评估，并提出了两种基于提示的引导方法：查询接地(Q-ground)和系统提示接地(P-ground)。

Result: 所有测试模型的操作安全性表现都很差，最强模型Qwen-3(235B)和Mistral(24B)分别只有77.77%和79.96%，而GPT模型在62-73%之间，Phi模型48-70%，Gemma和Llama-3分别只有39.53%和23.84%。提示引导方法能显著提升性能，Q-ground提升达23%，P-ground提升更大，Llama-3.3(70B)提升41%，Qwen-3(30B)提升27%。

Conclusion: 操作安全性是LLM部署的关键问题，当前所有模型都远未达到可靠水平。基于提示的引导方法为改善操作安全性提供了有前景的第一步，但仍需更多干预措施来确保LLM智能体的可靠部署。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

TL;DR: SCUBA是一个用于评估Salesforce平台上客户关系管理(CRM)工作流程的计算机使用代理基准测试，包含300个基于真实用户访谈的任务实例，涵盖三种主要角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估企业级任务自动化方面存在不足，需要更真实的基准来评估计算机使用代理在复杂业务软件生态系统中的表现。

Method: 在Salesforce沙盒环境中运行，支持并行执行和细粒度评估指标，测试了零样本和演示增强设置下的多种代理设计范式。

Result: 开源模型代理在零样本设置下成功率低于5%，而基于闭源模型的代理可达39%成功率；演示增强设置可将成功率提升至50%，同时减少13%时间和16%成本。

Conclusion: SCUBA基准突显了企业任务自动化的挑战和代理解决方案的前景，通过提供真实且可解释的评估来加速可靠计算机使用代理的发展。

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

Motivation: 大语言模型的快速发展推动了对AI推理基础设施的巨大需求，但高端GPU的高资本和运营成本使得AI数据中心的TCO成为云提供商的关键问题。传统数据中心生命周期管理难以跟上AI模型的快速演进、资源需求增长和硬件多样性。

Method: 提出一个整体生命周期管理框架，协调优化构建、硬件更新和运营三个阶段的决策，考虑工作负载动态、硬件演进和系统老化。分析电力、冷却和网络配置对长期TCO的影响，探索与硬件趋势一致的更新策略，并利用运营软件优化降低成本。

Result: 该系统将总拥有成本降低高达40%，相比传统方法显著提升成本效益。

Conclusion: 解锁AI数据中心全部潜力需要重新思考整个生命周期管理，提出的整体框架为未来AI数据中心生命周期管理提供了指导方针。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

TL;DR: HilbertA是一种2D感知且GPU高效的稀疏注意力机制，通过希尔伯特曲线重排序图像token实现连续内存布局，在保持空间邻域的同时显著加速扩散变换器的注意力计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩散变换器的稀疏注意力设计中难以兼顾二维空间局部性和GPU效率，往往导致非连续内存访问问题。

Method: 使用希尔伯特曲线重排序图像token实现连续内存布局，采用跨层滑动调度实现长距离信息传播，并引入小型中央共享区域增强跨区块通信和位置感知。

Result: 在Flux.1-dev上，HilbertA在生成1024×1024图像时实现2.3倍注意力加速，在2048×2048时达到4.17倍加速，同时图像质量与基线相当或更好。

Conclusion: HilbertA证明了硬件对齐的二维稀疏注意力在高分辨率图像生成中的可行性，成功解决了空间局部性与GPU效率的权衡问题。

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

Motivation: 评估LLM在复杂、开放性的前沿物理研究挑战中的推理能力，了解物理学家希望LLM协助完成哪些推理任务，填补当前基准测试与真实物理研究需求之间的差距。

Method: 创建CritPt基准测试，包含71个模拟入门级完整研究项目的复合挑战和190个更细粒度的检查点任务。所有问题由50+活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究原创设计，采用抗猜测和机器可验证的答案格式，并通过定制化的自动评分流程进行评估。

Result: 当前最先进LLM在孤立检查点上显示出早期潜力，但在完整研究规模挑战上表现不佳：基础模型最佳平均准确率仅4.0%（GPT-5），配备编码工具后适度提升至约10%。

Conclusion: CritPt揭示了当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间存在巨大差距，为开发科学基础的AI工具提供了指导基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

TL;DR: 该研究通过蜕变测试评估了三个小型语言模型在RAG系统中的公平性，发现微小的人口统计变化可能破坏三分之一的蜕变关系，其中种族线索是最主要的偏差来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在安全性和公平性问题，包括已知的数据投毒、提示注入攻击，以及公平性缺陷和幻觉问题。RAG虽然能缓解幻觉，但检索内容可能引入或放大偏差，需要评估其公平性影响。

Method: 采用蜕变测试方法，在提示中引入受控的人口统计扰动，评估三个HuggingFace上的小型语言模型在情感分析任务中的公平性，这些模型都集成在RAG管道中。

Result: 结果显示，微小的人口统计变化可能破坏高达三分之一的蜕变关系。失败分析揭示了持续的偏差层次结构，涉及种族线索的扰动是违反公平性的主要原因。

Conclusion: RAG中的检索组件必须精心策划以防止偏差放大。研究结果为开发人员、测试人员和小型组织提供了实用警示，提醒他们在采用可访问的小型语言模型时不应损害公平性或可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

Motivation: 强化学习在机器人、工业和医疗领域的部署面临两个主要障碍：难以指定准确奖励函数，以及不安全、数据密集的探索风险。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：首先从无奖励的专家演示数据集中学习安全初始策略，然后使用基于偏好的在线人类反馈进行微调。提出BRIDGE算法，通过不确定性加权目标整合两种信号。

Result: 在离散和连续控制的MuJoCo环境中验证，BRIDGE相比单独的行为克隆和在线偏好强化学习实现了更低的遗憾。遗憾边界随离线演示数量减少，明确连接离线数据量与在线样本效率。

Conclusion: 为设计更样本高效的交互智能体建立了理论基础，证明了离线到在线方法的有效性。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

Method: 从机器人演示和人类视频中提取进度估计信号，通过建模帧对之间的时间距离来学习奖励函数，为强化学习提供逐步代理奖励。

Result: 在10个Meta-World任务中，TimeRewarder显著改善了稀疏奖励任务的RL性能，在9/10任务中达到近乎完美的成功率，仅需每个任务20万次环境交互，超越了先前方法和手动设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: TimeRewarder展示了从多样化视频源获取丰富奖励信号的潜力，特别是能够利用真实世界人类视频进行预训练，为可扩展的奖励学习提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.
