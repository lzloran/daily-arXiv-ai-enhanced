### [1] [Interpreting Public Sentiment in Diplomacy Events: A Counterfactual Analysis Framework Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20367)
*Leyi Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个新颖框架，通过修改外交事件叙述来将公众情绪从负面转向中性或正面，成功率达到70%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众情绪在外交中至关重要，但传统方法耗时耗力且缺乏前瞻性分析能力

Method: 训练语言模型预测公众反应，构建外交事件数据集，基于传播理论预定义文本特征，开发反事实生成算法系统修改文本

Result: 框架成功将公众情绪转向更有利状态，成功率达到70%

Conclusion: 该框架可作为外交官、政策制定者和传播专家的实用工具，提供数据驱动的见解来塑造更理想的公众情绪

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

### [2] [Speaker Style-Aware Phoneme Anchoring for Improved Cross-Lingual Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20373)
*Shreya G. Upadhyay,Carlos Busso,Chi-Chun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于说话人风格感知的音素锚定框架，用于跨语言语音情感识别，通过在说话人和音素空间进行双空间锚定来改善跨语言情感迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言语音情感识别面临不同语言间语音变异性和说话人表达风格差异的挑战，需要能够对齐不同说话人和语言间情感外化的框架。

Method: 通过基于图聚类的说话人社区构建来捕捉共享的说话人特征，并在说话人和音素空间应用双空间锚定技术。

Result: 在MSP-Podcast（英语）和BIIC-Podcast（台湾普通话）语料库上的评估显示，该方法相比竞争基线具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨语言情感表征的共同性提供了有价值的见解，证明了双空间锚定在跨语言情感识别中的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CFDLLMBench是一个用于评估大语言模型在计算流体动力学领域能力的基准测试套件，包含三个组件来测试LLM的CFD知识、数值物理推理和工作流实现能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM在一般NLP任务中表现良好，但在自动化复杂物理系统数值实验方面的应用仍未被充分探索。CFD作为计算科学的重要工具，为评估LLM的科学能力提供了独特挑战。

Method: 开发了包含CFDQuery、CFDCodeBench和FoamBench三个互补组件的基准套件，基于真实CFD实践，结合详细任务分类和严格评估框架，评估代码可执行性、解精度和数值收敛行为。

Result: CFDLLMBench为LLM驱动的复杂物理系统数值实验自动化提供了坚实的开发和评估基础。

Conclusion: 该基准测试建立了评估LLM在CFD领域能力的标准框架，有助于推动LLM在科学计算自动化中的应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of
complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains
underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past
decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging
testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce
CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components --
CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM
performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge,
numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation
of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines
a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver
reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability,
solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes
a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation
of numerical experiments for complex physical systems. Code and data are

### [4] [Assessing Classical Machine Learning and Transformer-based Approaches for Detecting AI-Generated Research Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20375)
*Sharanya Parimanoharan,Ruwan D. Nawarathna*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多种机器学习方法在区分ChatGPT-3.5生成的文本与人类撰写文本方面的性能，发现DistilBERT表现最佳，而集成学习方法未能超越单一最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，AI生成文本与人类文本的界限变得模糊，这引发了学术诚信、知识产权和错误信息传播等紧迫问题，需要可靠的AI文本检测方法来维护人类真实性并建立数字通信信任。

Method: 使用包含250对研究摘要的标注数据集，测试和比较了经典机器学习方法（基于词袋、词性标注和TF-IDF特征的逻辑回归）和基于Transformer的方法（BERT增强N-gram、DistilBERT、BERT加轻量级分类器、LSTM-based N-gram模型），并评估了这些模型的集成效果。

Result: DistilBERT取得了整体最佳性能，逻辑回归和BERT-Custom提供了稳健的替代方案，而LSTM和BERT-N-gram方法表现较差。三个最佳模型的最大投票集成未能超越DistilBERT本身。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的单一表示方法优于模型多样性，为开发更强大的检测框架奠定了基础，需要更大更丰富的数据集来跟上不断改进的生成式AI模型。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

### [5] [ConceptViz: A Visual Analytics Approach for Exploring Concepts in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20376)
*Haoxuan Li,Zhen Wen,Qiqi Jiang,Chenxiao Li,Yuwei Wu,Yuchen Yang,Yiyao Wang,Xiuqi Huang,Minfeng Zhu,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConceptViz是一个可视化分析系统，用于探索大语言模型中的概念表示，通过识别-解释-验证的流程帮助研究人员理解SAE特征与人类概念之间的对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然稀疏自编码器(SAEs)是提取LLM可解释特征的有前景技术，但SAE特征并不天然与人类可理解的概念对齐，导致解释过程繁琐且劳动密集。

Method: ConceptViz实现了新颖的识别=>解释=>验证流程，使用户能够使用感兴趣的概念查询SAEs，交互式探索概念-特征对齐，并通过模型行为验证对应关系。

Result: 通过两个使用场景和用户研究表明，ConceptViz通过简化LLM中有意义概念表示的发现和验证过程，增强了可解释性研究。

Conclusion: ConceptViz有助于研究人员构建更准确的LLM特征心智模型，其代码和用户指南已公开可用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at
https://github.com/Happy-Hippo209/ConceptViz.

### [6] [SKILL-RAG: Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20377)
*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SKILL-RAG是一种利用模型自我知识来过滤检索内容的新方法，通过强化学习框架在句子级别筛选有用信息，提高RAG性能并减少输入文档数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索系统可能返回不相关内容，导致模型产生幻觉。需要理解模型的"已知"和"未知"知识来更好地整合内部和外部知识

Method: 提出SKILL-RAG方法，使用强化学习训练框架显式提取模型自我知识，在句子级别粒度过滤无关内容

Result: 在多个问答基准测试中，SKILL-RAG不仅提高了生成质量，还显著减少了输入文档数量

Conclusion: 实验验证了自我知识在指导高质量检索选择中的重要性

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

### [7] [Beyond Global Emotion: Fine-Grained Emotional Speech Synthesis with Dynamic Word-Level Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20378)
*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emo-FiLM是一个细粒度情感建模框架，用于基于LLM的文本转语音系统，通过词级情感控制实现动态情感转换


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感TTS系统依赖句子级控制，无法捕捉句子内部的情感动态变化，需要更细粒度的情感建模方法

Method: 使用Emo-FiLM框架，将emotion2vec的帧级特征对齐到词语获得词级情感标注，通过FiLM层映射并直接调制文本嵌入实现词级情感控制

Result: 实验表明Emo-FiLM在全局和细粒度任务上都优于现有方法，证明了其在表达性语音合成中的有效性和通用性

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM成功解决了情感TTS中动态情感转换的挑战，为更自然的人机交互提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

### [8] [USB-Rec: An Effective Framework for Improving Conversational Recommendation Capability of Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20381)
*Jianyu Wen,Jingyun Wang,Cilin Yan,Jiayin Cai,Xiaolong Jiang,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了USB-Rec框架，通过用户模拟器为基础的方法，在模型层面提升LLMs在对话推荐系统中的性能，包括RL训练阶段的偏好优化数据集构建和推理阶段的自增强策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLMs的对话推荐方法主要关注利用LLMs的总结和分析能力，而忽视了训练问题，因此需要开发集成训练-推理的框架来提升模型性能。

Method: 1. 设计基于LLM的偏好优化数据集构建策略用于RL训练；2. 在推理阶段提出自增强策略进一步挖掘RL训练获得的对话推荐潜力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续优于之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: USB-Rec框架通过集成训练和推理策略，有效提升了LLMs在对话推荐任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

### [9] [Document Summarization with Conformal Importance Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20461)
*Bruce Kuwahara,Chen-Yuan Lin,Xiao Shi Huang,Kin Kwan Leung,Jullian Arta Yapeter,Ilya Stanevich,Felipe Perez,Jesse C. Cresswell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Conformal Importance Summarization框架，使用保形预测为摘要生成提供严格的内容覆盖保证，确保在医疗、法律、金融等高风险领域的关键内容不被遗漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的自动摘要系统在关键领域缺乏对重要内容包含的可靠保证，需要一种能够提供严格覆盖保证的方法。

Method: 通过在校准集上校准句子级重要性分数的阈值，实现具有用户指定覆盖率和召回率的抽取式文档摘要，该方法与现有黑盒大语言模型无缝集成。

Result: 在已建立的摘要基准测试中，Conformal Importance Summarization实现了理论保证的信息覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该方法可以与现有技术结合实现可靠、可控的自动摘要，为AI摘要工具在关键应用中的安全部署铺平道路。

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

Method: 采用模块化、仅推理的流水线，集成语音转录、OCR、物体和深度伪造检测、视频到文本摘要以及声明验证等技术。

Result: 在两个手动标注的多语言TikTok视频数据集上验证，系统F1加权分数超过70%，表现出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: ShortCheck为短视频平台的虚假信息检测提供了有效的自动化解决方案，能够显著提高事实核查的效率。

Abstract: Short-form video platforms like TikTok present unique challenges for
misinformation detection due to their multimodal, dynamic, and noisy content.
We present ShortCheck, a modular, inference-only pipeline with a user-friendly
interface that automatically identifies checkworthy short-form videos to help
human fact-checkers. The system integrates speech transcription, OCR, object
and deepfake detection, video-to-text summarization, and claim verification.
ShortCheck is validated by evaluating it on two manually annotated datasets

### [11] [MARS: toward more efficient multi-agent collaboration for LLM reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20502)
*Xiao Wang,Jia Wang,Yijie Wang,Pengtao Dang,Sha Cao,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARS是一种基于角色的多智能体协作框架，通过模拟审稿流程来提升大语言模型的推理能力，在保持与多智能体辩论相同准确率的同时，将token使用量和推理时间减少约50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体辩论虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但由于涉及多个智能体间的频繁通信，带来了巨大的计算开销。MARS旨在解决这一效率问题。

Method: MARS采用审稿流程设计：作者智能体生成初始解决方案，审稿人智能体独立提供决策和评论，元审稿人整合反馈做出最终决策并指导进一步修订，避免了审稿人间的交互成本。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MARS与多智能体辩论的准确率相当，但token使用量和推理时间均减少了约50%。

Conclusion: MARS提供了一种高效的多智能体协作框架，在保持推理质量的同时显著降低了计算成本，为大语言模型的推理能力提升提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at
https://github.com/xwang97/MARS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了SiniticMTError数据集，这是一个为英语到普通话、粤语和吴语的机器翻译提供错误标注的新资源，包含错误跨度、类型和严重性标注，旨在支持低资源语言的机器翻译研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器翻译近年来取得重大进展，但许多低资源语言（如粤语和吴语）由于缺乏大规模训练数据和语言资源，进展仍然有限。这些语言虽然拥有超过8000万使用者，但相关研究资源匮乏。

Method: 基于现有平行语料库构建SiniticMTError数据集，由母语者进行严格的标注过程，包括错误跨度、错误类型和错误严重性标注，并进行标注者间一致性分析、迭代反馈以及错误类型和严重性模式分析。

Result: 创建了一个包含英语到普通话、粤语和吴语机器翻译错误标注的数据集，为机器翻译社区提供了可用于微调具有错误检测能力模型的资源。

Conclusion: SiniticMTError数据集支持翻译质量估计、错误感知生成和低资源语言评估研究，为低资源语言的机器翻译发展提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

### [13] [SwasthLLM: a Unified Cross-Lingual, Multi-Task, and Meta-Learning Zero-Shot Framework for Medical Diagnosis Using Contrastive Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20567)
*Ayan Sar,Pranav Singh Puri,Sumit Aich,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SwasthLLM是一个统一的多语言医疗诊断框架，无需语言特定微调即可在英语、印地语和孟加拉语上实现零样本跨语言疾病诊断，通过多任务学习和对比学习实现语言不变表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言医疗环境中临床文本自动诊断的挑战，特别是在低资源语言中标注医疗数据稀缺以及跨人群语言变异性的问题。

Method: 基于多语言XLM-RoBERTa编码器，结合语言感知注意力机制、孪生对比学习模块、翻译一致性模块和对比投影头，采用多任务学习和元学习策略进行训练。

Result: 在监督设置下达到97.22%的测试准确率和97.17%的F1分数；在零样本场景下，印地语准确率92.78%，孟加拉语准确率73.33%。

Conclusion: SwasthLLM在多语言医疗诊断中表现出强大的泛化能力，特别是在低资源语言环境下具有显著优势。

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

### [14] [Dynamic Reasoning Chains through Depth-Specialized Mixture-of-Experts in Transformer Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20577)
*Sampurna Roy,Ayan Sar,Anurag Kaushish,Kanav Gupta,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态推理链框架DS-MoE，通过深度专业化专家混合模型，根据输入复杂度动态组装推理链，实现计算效率和推理质量的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer对所有输入采用相同的处理深度，导致简单查询浪费资源，复杂问题推理深度不足。需要一种能根据输入复杂度自适应调整处理深度的架构。

Method: DS-MoE扩展了专家混合范式，引入针对不同推理深度的专家模块（浅层模式识别、组合推理、逻辑推理等），通过学习路由网络动态组装定制推理链。

Result: 在The Pile数据集上，DS-MoE相比统一深度Transformer节省16%计算量，推理速度提升35%，复杂多步推理准确率提高2.8%，同时提供可解释的推理链。

Conclusion: DS-MoE证明了深度专业化模块化处理能同时提升大规模语言模型的效率、推理质量和可解释性，是自适应神经架构的重要进展。

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in

*Ayan Sar,Sampurna Roy,Kanav Gupta,Anurag Kaushish,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HRT是一种基于小波变换的多分辨率Transformer架构，通过同时处理从字符到语篇级别的多尺度语言信息，实现了O(nlogn)计算复杂度，在多个基准测试中优于标准Transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer将文本处理为扁平标记序列，忽视了语言的层次结构，导致二次计算复杂度、弱组合泛化能力和语篇级建模不足的问题。

Method: 提出分层分辨率Transformer(HRT)，构建多分辨率注意力机制，实现自下而上的组合和自上而下的语境化，通过跨尺度的指数序列缩减降低计算复杂度。

Result: HRT在GLUE、SuperGLUE、Long Range Arena和WikiText-103等基准测试中平均提升3.8%-6.1%，内存使用减少42%，推理延迟降低37%。

Conclusion: HRT是首个将计算结构与人类语言层次组织对齐的架构，证明多尺度小波启发的处理既能获得理论效率增益，又能实际提升语言理解能力。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

*Amin Karimi Monsefi,Nikhil Bhendawade,Manuel Rafael Ciosici,Dominic Culver,Yizhe Zhang,Irina Belousova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FS-DFM是一种少步离散流匹配模型，通过将采样步数作为显式参数训练，在保持质量的同时实现快速语言生成，相比传统扩散模型可提升128倍采样速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型生成速度慢，而标准离散扩散模型需要数百到数千次模型评估才能达到高质量，存在速度与质量的权衡问题。

Method: 提出FS-DFM模型，核心思想是将采样步数作为显式参数，训练模型在不同步数预算下保持一致性，配合可靠的更新规则和从长轨迹中蒸馏的强教师指导。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，FS-DFM仅用8个采样步骤就达到了与1,024步离散流基线相当的困惑度，采样速度提升128倍，延迟和吞吐量相应改善。

Conclusion: FS-DFM通过少步采样实现了高质量语言生成，在保持性能的同时显著提升了生成效率，为快速语言生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了PRECOG语料库，研究仅通过任务描述和配置来预测模型性能的可行性，无需实际运行实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型评估中的瓶颈：能否在运行实验前预测结果，以支持更智能的实验优先级排序。

Method: 构建PRECOG语料库，使用检索模块从已发表论文中提取信息，在零泄漏设置下进行性能预测。

Result: 任务具有挑战性但可行，GPT-5等模型能达到中等预测性能，MAE最低可达8.7。

Conclusion: 该研究为开放式预期评估提供了初步步骤，支持难度估计和更智能的实验优先级排序。

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种方法来构建针对日语口语评估任务的语音识别器，通过多任务训练和模型融合来缓解标注数据稀缺问题，显著降低了音素标签错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语虽然是资源丰富的语言，但包含重音标记的准确音素转录训练数据很少，需要解决数据稀疏性问题来构建准确的日语语音识别器。

Method: 1. 多任务训练方案：引入辅助损失函数来估计输入信号的文本标签和音高模式，从而利用仅有文本标注的语料进行训练。2. 模型融合：将基于音素字母串的估计器和基于文本标记序列的估计器进行融合，使用基于有限状态转换器的算法进行组合。

Result: 提出的方法将CSJ核心评估集的平均音节标签错误率从12.3%降低到7.1%，相比通用多语言识别器具有明显优势。

Conclusion: 多任务学习和模型融合对于构建准确的音素识别器是有效的，所提出的方法在日语口语评估任务中表现优于通用方法。

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖框架，首次将LLM提取的知识与预训练分子模型的结构特征相结合，以增强分子性质预测（MPP）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GNN和自监督学习在MPP方面取得了进展，但人类先验知识的整合仍然不可或缺。LLMs存在知识差距和幻觉问题，特别是在研究较少的分子性质方面。

Method: 通过提示LLMs生成领域相关知识和可执行代码进行分子向量化，产生基于知识的特征，然后与结构表示融合。使用了GPT-4o、GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1三种LLMs进行知识提取。

Result: 大量实验表明，该集成方法优于现有方法，证实了LLM衍生知识与结构信息的结合为MPP提供了稳健有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM提取的知识与结构特征的整合是提升分子性质预测性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RedHerring攻击方法，旨在使攻击检测模型不可靠，同时保持分类器的正确性，从而在分类器和检测器之间制造矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本攻击检测模型虽然能成功识别对抗性文本，但其可靠性尚未得到充分研究。作者希望探索检测模型可能面临的新型威胁。

Method: 提出RedHerring攻击方法，通过修改文本使检测模型误报攻击，同时确保分类器仍能正确分类，从而破坏检测模型的可信度。

Result: 在4个数据集上对3个检测器和4个分类器的测试显示，RedHerring能将检测准确率降低20-71个百分点，同时保持或提高分类器准确率。

Conclusion: 这种新型威胁模型揭示了攻击者可能针对检测模型的新方式，并提出了简单的置信度检查作为初步防御措施。

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

*Abhinay Shankar Belde,Rohit Ramkumar,Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的攻击选择策略（Hybrid和Dynamic Select），通过结合BinarySelect和GreedySelect的优势，显著降低了对抗性文本攻击所需的查询次数，同时保持攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于transformer的架构复杂性增加，对抗性文本攻击的计算成本急剧上升，现有黑盒攻击方法需要大量查询，对资源有限的研究者来说效率低下且不实用。

Method: Hybrid Select通过引入大小阈值来决定使用哪种选择算法，将广义BinarySelect技术与GreedySelect结合；Dynamic Select通过学习每种选择方法应应用于何种长度的文本来结合广义Binary和GreedySelect。

Result: 在4个数据集和6个目标模型上，最佳方法（句子级Hybrid Select）能够将每次攻击所需的查询次数平均减少25.82%，同时不损失攻击效果。

Conclusion: 提出的新攻击选择策略有效解决了对抗性文本攻击中的高计算成本问题，为资源有限的研究者提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MI-Fuse是一个去噪标签融合框架，通过结合大型音频语言模型和源域训练的SER分类器作为辅助教师，在目标域无标签数据上训练学生模型，以解决语音情感识别中的域不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署中的语音情感识别在域不匹配情况下经常失败，源数据不可用且强大的LALM只能通过API访问。研究目标是仅使用未标记的目标域音频和API-only的LALM，能否训练出在目标域超越LALM性能的学生模型。

Method: 提出MI-Fuse框架，使用LALM和源域训练的SER分类器作为双教师模型，通过互信息加权的多随机预测融合，结合指数移动平均教师来稳定训练过程。

Result: 在三个公共情感数据集和六个跨域转移任务上的实验显示，学生模型持续超越LALM，比最强基线高出3.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法在不共享源数据的情况下增强了情感感知语音系统，实现了现实的适应能力。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

Result: 该方法在多种语言上通过广泛实证分析证明，能够显著提升解析性能，同时支持使用更紧凑的语法。

Conclusion: 崩溃松弛神经参数化有效解决了无监督语法归纳中的表达能力瓶颈问题，为学习可解释的层次结构提供了更高效的途径。

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive
empirical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有问答模型在跨领域任务中置信度评估不准确的问题，提出一种能够自动优化子问题推理路径的通用框架。

Method: 首先筛选子问题集合探索多样化推理路径，然后比较答案候选的置信度分数来选择最可靠的最终答案，完全基于模型自身的置信度评分。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提出了有效的置信度引导推理框架，还深入分析了子问题数量和质量对模型推理鲁棒性的影响，为可靠推理提供了重要见解。

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

Motivation: 传统观点认为SFT会损害LLM的通用能力，但作者希望通过实证和理论分析重新评估这种权衡，并寻找更有效的领域适应策略。

Method: 通过实验验证小学习率的效果，提出TALR方法，并与L2正则化、LoRA、模型平均、FLOW等基线方法进行比较。

Result: 实验表明小学习率确实能改善权衡，而TALR在所有基线方法中表现最佳，能更好地平衡领域特定收益和通用能力。

Conclusion: 为LLM领域适应提供实用指南：使用小学习率获得有利权衡，当需要更强平衡时采用TALR策略。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的内部表示基本单元（神经元或特征）存在多义性、重建不可靠和不稳定性等问题，限制了对其机制的理解，需要定义更可靠的基本单元。

Method: 提出原子理论，定义原子为基本单元，引入原子内积校正表示偏移，证明原子满足RIP条件，训练阈值激活的稀疏自编码器在Gemma2-2B、Gemma2-9B和Llama3.1-8B模型上进行验证。

Result: 在多个模型上实现了99.9%的稀疏重建，99.8%的原子满足唯一性条件（相比神经元的0.5%和特征的68.2%），表明原子能更准确地捕捉LLMs的内在表示。

Conclusion: 原子理论为大语言模型的内部表示理解提供了理论框架，为机制可解释性研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

*Genki Kusano*

TL;DR: 本文提出对话式提示方法，通过将用户评论重新表述为多轮对话来解决少样本和无训练条件下的个性化评论生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中常面临少样本和无训练的情况，现有方法假设目标用户有大量评论历史或需要额外模型训练，而大型语言模型虽然能处理低资源设置但效果依赖提示工程。

Method: 提出对话式提示方法，包括简单对话式提示（SCP）仅使用用户自身评论，对比对话式提示（CCP）插入其他用户或LLM的评论作为错误回复并让模型纠正。

Result: 在8个产品领域和5个LLM上的实验表明，传统非对话提示产生的评论与随机用户相似，而SCP和CCP产生的评论更接近目标用户风格，即使每个用户只有2条评论。

Conclusion: 对话式提示为少样本和无训练约束下的评论生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

Motivation: LLMs在复杂任务中表现出强大推理能力，但在知识密集型场景如知识图谱问答中存在幻觉和事实错误问题，主要原因是结构化知识图谱与非结构化查询之间的语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出Enrich-on-Graph框架，利用LLMs的先验知识丰富知识图谱，设计三个图质量评估指标分析查询-图对齐，并通过理论验证优化目标。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

*Taehee Park,Heejin Do,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoCO是一种新颖的语法错误校正方法，通过先利用大语言模型进行过度校正以提高召回率，然后使用小模型进行后校正来平衡精度和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调的小语言模型在语法错误校正中精度高但召回率低，而大语言模型则倾向于过度校正导致精度低。PoCO旨在结合两者的优势，平衡精度和召回率。

Method: PoCO首先使用大语言模型进行过度校正以最大化召回率，然后通过微调的小模型进行有针对性的后校正，识别和修正错误输出。

Result: 实验表明，PoCO在保持竞争力的精度的同时有效提高了召回率，从而提升了语法错误校正的整体质量。

Conclusion: PoCO通过结合大语言模型的生成能力和小监督模型的可靠性，成功平衡了语法错误校正的性能，提高了整体校正质量。

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为cheat-sheet ICL的新方法，通过将多示例上下文学习的信息提炼为简洁的文本摘要（cheat sheet），在推理时使用更少的token达到相似或更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型多示例上下文学习计算成本高的问题，因为需要处理大量输入token。

Method: 将多示例ICL中的信息提炼成简洁的文本摘要（cheat sheet），在推理时仅使用这个摘要作为上下文，而不需要完整的示例。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理任务上，cheat-sheet ICL使用更少的token实现了与多示例ICL相当或更好的性能，并且无需测试时检索就能达到基于检索的ICL的效果。

Conclusion: cheat-sheet ICL是利用LLM进行下游任务的一个实用替代方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在云服务中的广泛应用，用户输入可能泄露敏感信息，现有文本匿名化技术难以平衡隐私保护与文本自然性。

Method: 采用零样本、基于树搜索的迭代句子重写算法，通过结构化搜索引导的奖励模型，动态探索重写空间，逐步重写隐私敏感片段。

Result: 在隐私敏感数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线方法，在隐私保护和实用性之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM应用中的隐私保护提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在保护敏感信息的同时保持文本的连贯性和自然性。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

Motivation: 现有RAG问答系统的引文通常在句子或段落级别，存在两个问题：长句子包含大量无关内容；句子级引文可能遗漏验证所需的关键信息，增加用户验证负担。

Result: 在构建的数据集上实验证明，该方法能生成更高质量和可读性的引文。

Conclusion: 子句级引文方法能有效减少用户验证生成输出正确性所需的工作量，提供更简洁充分的引文支持。

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语言建模中显示出潜力，但缺乏精确的概率估计，导致生成过程不可预测且不一致。需要控制关键token来引导生成方向。

Method: 提出WeFT加权SFT方法，根据token的熵值分配不同权重，该方法基于扩散理论设计。

Result: 在s1K、s1K-1.1和3k样本上训练，在Sudoku、Countdown、GSM8K和MATH-500四个推理基准上分别比标准SFT相对提升39%、64%和83%。

Conclusion: WeFT方法有效解决了扩散语言模型SFT的挑战，显著提升了推理性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策通常考虑多个选项而非单一答案，但现有医学推理模型主要训练生成单一答案，这限制了模型的实用性。

Method: 研究提示和微调两种方法：监督微调（SFT）模仿标注响应，强化微调（RFT）通过奖励函数激励探索；提出了针对排名列表格式的新奖励函数。

Result: SFT模型在某些答案格式上泛化良好，但RFT模型在多种格式上表现更稳健；模型可能无法选择基准的首选答案，但能识别有效答案。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究医学推理模型生成排名列表的方法，为开发超越单一答案的替代格式提供了初步探索。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在长文档摘要任务中存在信息丢失、事实不一致和连贯性问题，需要新的方法来提高摘要质量。

Method: 采用对抗性多智能体框架，包含摘要生成器、摘要评审器、问题生成器、问题评审器和考生智能体，通过协作和对抗机制实现迭代优化。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的长文档摘要基准测试中，SummQ在ROUGE、BERTScore、LLM-as-a-Judge和人工评估指标上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一种新的长文档摘要方法，利用对抗性智能体协作来提高摘要质量，多智能体协作动态和提问机制被证明是有效的。

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

TL;DR: 提出MemLens方法，通过分析数值标记生成过程中的概率轨迹来检测LLM中的记忆化现象，发现被污染样本在模型早期层就锁定答案，而干净样本则在整个模型深度中逐渐积累证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法主要依赖表面词汇重叠和困惑度，对隐式污染数据泛化能力差，需要更有效的记忆化检测方法。

Method: MemLens通过分析数值标记在生成过程中的概率轨迹，识别被污染样本的"捷径"行为模式，并通过LoRA微调注入设计样本进行验证。

Result: 发现被污染样本和干净样本具有明显分离的推理轨迹，被污染样本在早期层就表现出高置信度锁定答案的行为。

Conclusion: MemLens能够捕捉到真正的记忆化信号而非虚假相关性，为LLM记忆化检测提供了有效的新方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

### [37] [Cross-Linguistic Analysis of Memory Load in Sentence Comprehension: Linear Distance and Structural Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20916)
*Krishna Aggarwal*

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具调用研究主要集中于英语，缺乏对其他语言（如阿拉伯语）的研究，需要了解如何为阿拉伯语等语言开发有效的工具调用功能。

Method: 使用开源阿拉伯语LLM的基座和训练后变体进行实验，翻译并适配了两个开源工具调用数据集为阿拉伯语版本，研究了三种关键策略：阿拉伯语数据vs跨语言迁移、通用指令调优的影响、特定工具微调的价值。

Result: 实验结果为开发阿拉伯语工具增强代理提供了关键见解，确定了最优策略。

Conclusion: 研究填补了阿拉伯语工具调用研究的空白，为开发鲁棒的阿拉伯语工具增强代理提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文证明因果掩码（causal mask）在Transformer解码器中能够诱导位置依赖的注意力模式，即使没有参数或输入中的因果依赖。研究发现因果掩码与RoPE的交互会扭曲RoPE的相对注意力模式，使其变为非相对模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RoPE等显式位置编码是Transformer解码器中位置信息的主要来源，但因果掩码也提供位置信息。本研究旨在探索因果掩码作为位置信息来源的重要性。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究相结合的方法。理论分析表明因果掩码会诱导倾向于邻近查询-键对的注意力模式；实证分析在训练好的模型中验证了这一行为。

Result: 研究发现因果掩码能够诱导位置依赖的注意力模式，且与RoPE的交互会扭曲RoPE的相对注意力模式。在现代大语言模型中一致观察到这种效应。

Conclusion: 因果掩码应被视为与显式位置编码同等重要的位置信息来源，在模型设计中需要同时考虑这两种位置信息机制。

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实场景中的应用增多，需要系统评估它们同时遵循多条指令的能力，但评估所有可能的指令组合在计算上不可行。

Method: 创建了两个基准测试：ManyIFEval用于文本生成（最多10条指令），StyleMBPP用于代码生成（最多6条指令）。在10个LLM上进行实验，并开发了三种回归模型来预测性能。

Result: 实验显示随着指令数量增加，所有模型的性能都持续下降。逻辑回归模型使用指令数量作为解释变量，能够以约10%的误差预测未见指令组合的性能。

Conclusion: 相对较小的样本量（ManyIFEval 500个，StyleMBPP 300个）足以进行性能估计，这为在各种指令组合下高效评估LLM提供了可行方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

Method: 创建了SoM-1K数据集，包含文本问题陈述和示意图。提出了DoI（图像描述）提示策略，提供专家生成的图像文本描述。评估了8个代表性基础模型（LLM和VLM）。

Result: 当前基础模型在工程问题上表现显著不足，最佳模型准确率仅56.6%。有趣的是，提供DoI的LLM通常优于直接处理图像的VLM。错误分析显示DoI能有效减少视觉误解错误。

Conclusion: 本研究为工程AI建立了严谨基准，强调需要开发更强大的多模态推理能力，特别是在科学和工程背景下。准确的文本描述可能比直接图像输入对当前基础模型更有效。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

### [44] [Which Cultural Lens Do Models Adopt? On Cultural Positioning Bias and Agentic Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21080)
*Yixin Wan,Xingrun Chen,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文识别并系统研究了LLMs中的文化定位偏见，提出了CultureLens基准和两种推理时缓解方法，证明基于代理的方法能有效减轻生成式LLMs中的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs存在文化定位偏见，倾向于从主流美国文化视角生成内容，将其他文化视为局外人，这种偏见可能延续微妙的不公平问题。

Method: 提出CultureLens基准（4000个生成提示和3个评估指标），通过文化情境访谈脚本生成任务量化偏见。提出两种缓解方法：基于提示的FIP方法和基于代理的MFA框架（包括单代理和多代理两种管道）。

Result: 对5个最先进LLMs的实证评估显示，模型在美国情境脚本中88%以上采用局内人语气，但对非主流文化主要采用局外人立场。基于代理的方法被证明是有效的缓解策略。

Conclusion: 文化定位偏见是LLMs中一个重要的公平性问题，基于代理的缓解方法为解决生成式LLMs中的偏见提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerHalluEval是首个针对波斯语的动态幻觉评估基准，通过三阶段LLM驱动流程和人工验证来检测外在和内在幻觉，评估显示LLMs在检测波斯语幻觉方面普遍存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在低资源语言（如波斯语）中的幻觉问题，波斯语缺乏专门的幻觉评估基准。

Method: 使用三阶段LLM驱动流程生成QA和摘要任务的合理答案，结合人工验证和标记对数概率选择最可信的幻觉实例，并引入波斯文化特定内容评估。

Result: 评估12个开源和闭源LLMs发现模型普遍难以检测波斯语幻觉，提供外部知识（如原始文档）可部分缓解幻觉问题，波斯语专用LLMs与其他模型在幻觉方面无显著差异。

Conclusion: PerHalluEval基准有效揭示了LLMs在波斯语中的幻觉问题，外部知识有助于缓解但问题依然存在，需要进一步改进模型对低资源语言的处理能力。

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

*Hyunseo Kim,Sangam Lee,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BESPOKE是一个用于评估搜索增强大语言模型个性化能力的基准测试，通过收集真实的人类聊天和搜索历史，结合细粒度偏好评分和反馈，系统性地评估个性化信息检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的搜索增强LLM虽然减轻了用户的认知负担，但无法充分满足多样化用户需求，缺乏对查询意图差异的识别和个性化信息呈现。当前系统如ChatGPT和Gemini尝试通过用户历史实现个性化，但缺乏系统性的评估方法。

Method: 通过长期深入的人类标注构建BESPOKE基准，标注者贡献自己的历史记录、编写具有详细信息需求的查询，并使用评分和诊断反馈评估响应。基准具有真实性和诊断性特点。

Result: 基于BESPOKE的系统分析揭示了信息寻求任务中有效个性化的关键要求，为个性化搜索增强LLM的细粒度评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: BESPOKE基准填补了搜索增强LLM个性化评估的空白，提供了真实且诊断性的评估框架，有助于推动个性化信息检索系统的发展。

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

### [47] [VoiceBBQ: Investigating Effect of Content and Acoustics in Social Bias of Spoken Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21108)
*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ是一个基于语音的偏见基准测试数据集，扩展了文本BBQ基准，用于评估语音语言模型在内容和声学两个维度上的社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语音的特殊性，语音语言模型的社会偏见可能来自内容和声学两个不同来源，需要专门的评估工具来诊断这两种偏见。

Method: 将BBQ数据集的所有上下文转换为受控的语音条件，生成可比较的准确率、偏见和一致性评分，用于评估语音语言模型。

Result: 评估LLaMA-Omni和Qwen2-Audio两个模型发现：LLaMA-Omni抵抗声学偏见但放大性别和口音偏见；Qwen2-Audio显著减弱这些偏见线索同时保持内容保真度。

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ提供了一个紧凑的即插即用测试平台，用于联合诊断语音语言模型的内容和声学偏见。

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

### [48] [Acoustic-based Gender Differentiation in Speech-aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21125)
*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新的数据集来系统分析语音语言模型中的声学性别偏见，发现模型在性别刻板印象问题上表现出男性导向的偏见，而在需要性别区分的语境中却做出性别无关的回应，这种矛盾模式主要源于Whisper语音编码器生成的男性导向声学标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音语言模型可能基于说话者性别对相同问题给出不同回应，存在声学性别偏见问题，需要系统分析这一现象。

Method: 构建包含9,208个语音样本的数据集，分为性别无关、性别刻板印象和性别依赖三类，评估LLaMA-Omni系列模型，并比较语音语言模型与对应骨干语言模型的表现。

Result: 模型在性别刻板印象问题上一致表现出男性导向回应，而在性别依赖问题上却做出性别无关回应；这种模式不受中性选项或语音感知性别影响，且主要源于Whisper语音编码器。

Conclusion: 当前语音语言模型未能成功消除性别偏见，优先考虑一般公平原则而非语境适当性，需要更复杂技术来正确处理语音技术中的性别信息。

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

*Lei Hei,Tingjing Liao,Yingxin Pei,Yiyang Qi,Jiaqi Wang,Ruiting Li,Feiliang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ROC框架，将多模态关系抽取重新定义为基于关系语义的检索任务，解决了传统分类方法忽略结构约束和语义表达能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态关系抽取方法采用基于分类的范式，存在两个主要局限：(1) 忽略实体类型和位置线索等结构约束；(2) 缺乏对细粒度关系理解的语义表达能力。

Method: ROC框架通过多模态编码器整合实体类型和位置信息，使用大语言模型将关系标签扩展为自然语言描述，并通过基于语义相似度的对比学习对齐实体-关系对。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在MNRE和MORE基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并表现出更强的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ROC框架通过检索范式有效解决了多模态关系抽取中的结构约束和语义表达问题，为关系理解提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究发现LLM在训练过程中会学习语法与领域之间的虚假相关性，这种相关性有时会覆盖提示语义，影响模型性能，甚至可能被用于绕过安全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM如何同时处理任务指令对的语义、领域和语法信息，特别是语法模板在训练数据中的普遍性及其对模型输出的影响。

Method: 使用合成训练数据集分析语法-领域相关性对OLMo-2模型性能的影响，并开发评估框架检测FlanV2数据集中的这种现象，同时进行安全微调案例研究。

Result: 语法-领域相关性会降低OLMo-2模型在实体知识任务上的性能（平均0.51±0.06），并在开放模型（OLMo-2-7B、Llama-4-Maverick）和闭源模型（GPT-4o）中均被发现，可用于绕过拒绝机制。

Conclusion: 需要明确测试语法-领域相关性，并确保训练数据中特别是领域内的语法多样性，以防止此类虚假相关性。

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幽默是人类的基本特质，其计算理解是NLP中最具挑战性的任务之一。幽默作为抽象、创造性且依赖语境的概念，需要大量推理能力来理解和创造，因此成为评估现代大语言模型常识知识和推理能力的合适任务。

Method: 本文采用文献综述的方法，系统梳理了计算幽默领域的研究现状，特别关注幽默生成和解释任务。通过分析现有研究成果，识别研究空白和技术瓶颈。

Result: 研究发现，尽管幽默理解具有基础NLP任务的所有特征，但在非双关语幽默的生成和解释方面研究仍然稀少，最先进的模型在幽默处理能力上仍远不及人类水平。

Conclusion: 研究强调了计算幽默处理作为NLP子学科的重要性，并基于幽默的主观性和伦理模糊性特点，提出了该领域未来研究的广泛方向。

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型科学推理中的两个主要瓶颈：显式检索导致推理碎片化（工具税）和多智能体管道稀释强解决方案（平均化问题）。

Method: 基于Monitor的隐式检索模块在token级别集成外部知识，结合分层解决方案精炼（HSR）和质量感知迭代推理（QAIR）进行结构化协作。

Result: 在Humanity's Last Exam Bio/Chem Gold上达到48.3%准确率（当前最高），比最强基线提升13.4点，同时减少53.5%的token使用和43.7%的智能体步骤。

Conclusion: 隐式增强和结构化精炼能够克服显式工具使用和统一聚合的低效性，错误分析显示推理失败和知识差距在85%案例中同时出现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于小语言模型（SLM）的聊天机器人存在的个人身份信息（PII）泄露风险，并提出了一种基于贪婪坐标梯度（GCG）的GEP方法来有效提取PII，实验显示其泄露检测效果比传统模板方法提升60倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在特定领域表现出与大型语言模型相当的性能，且训练和推理消耗更少资源，但其在下游任务中的个人身份信息泄露风险尚未被充分研究。

Method: 首先基于BioGPT微调出ChatBioGPT聊天机器人，然后提出GEP方法（基于贪婪坐标梯度的PII提取方法），该方法专门针对SLM条件下的PII泄露检测设计。

Result: 实验结果显示GEP方法比传统模板方法的PII泄露检测效果提升60倍，在更复杂的自由风格插入场景下仍能达到4.53%的泄露率。

Conclusion: 基于SLM的聊天机器人存在显著的PII泄露风险，传统模板方法在SLM条件下效果有限，而GEP方法能有效检测PII泄露，对医疗等敏感领域的AI应用安全具有重要意义。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

TL;DR: DisCoCLIP是一种多模态编码器，通过结合冻结的CLIP视觉变换器和新型张量网络文本编码器，显式编码句法结构，显著提升视觉语言模型对语言组合结构的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在大规模图像-文本对齐方面表现出色，但往往忽略语言组合结构，导致在依赖词序和谓词-参数结构的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 使用组合范畴语法解析器解析句子生成分布词张量，通过张量分解降低参数数量，采用自监督对比损失进行端到端训练。

Result: 将CLIP的SVO-Probes动词准确率从77.6%提升至82.4%，ARO归因和关系分数分别提高超过9%和4%，在新引入的SVO-Swap基准上达到93.7%。

Conclusion: 通过张量网络嵌入显式语言结构可以产生可解释、参数高效的表示，显著改善视觉语言任务中的组合推理能力。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

Motivation: 解决RLHF的可解释性差和奖励攻击问题，以及RLVR局限于正确性验证的局限性，提出结合人类偏好灵活性和规则验证精确性的新方法。

Method: 从自然语言反馈中提取可二元回答的原则（如信息准确性、代码可读性），将奖励模型训练构建为蕴含任务（响应是否满足任意原则）。

Result: 在RM-Bench上达到86.2%，JudgeBench上81.4%（截至2025年9月24日排行榜第一），对齐Qwen3-32B模型在MT-Bench、WildBench和Arena Hard v2上匹配或超越o3-mini和DeepSeek R1性能。

Conclusion: RLBFF提供了一种可解释、可定制的奖励建模方法，在推理成本低于5%的情况下实现最先进的性能，并提供了完整的开源实现方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

### [57] [CLaw: Benchmarking Chinese Legal Knowledge in Large Language Models - A Fine-grained Corpus and Reasoning Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21208)
*Xinzhe Xu,Liang Zhao,Hongshen Xu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLaw是一个专门评估大语言模型在中国法律知识应用方面表现的基准，包含64,849条法律条文和254个案例推理实例，揭示当前LLM在法律条文准确引用方面的严重不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在处理法律文本时可靠性不足，因为其预训练缺乏法律领域的专门化，需要专门基准来评估其法律知识和推理能力。

Method: 构建包含两个核心组件的CLaw基准：1）306部中国国家法律的细粒度语料库（64,849条目），2）254个基于最高法院案例的推理实例。

Result: 实证评估显示大多数当代LLM在准确复述法律条文方面表现显著不足，这严重影响了其法律推理的可靠性。

Conclusion: 实现可信赖的法律推理需要准确的知识检索（通过SFT或RAG增强）与强大通用推理能力的协同，本文为推进领域特定LLM推理提供了重要基准和见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

TL;DR: SGMem是一种基于句子图结构的长对话记忆管理方法，通过多粒度上下文组织提升长期对话问答性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事实提取或摘要的方法难以有效组织和检索不同粒度的对话信息，需要更好的记忆管理机制来处理超出LLM上下文窗口的长对话历史

Method: SGMem将对话表示为分块单元内的句子级图结构，捕捉轮次、回合和会话级别的关联，结合检索的原始对话与生成的记忆（摘要、事实和见解）

Result: 在LongMemEval和LoCoMo数据集上的实验表明，SGMem持续提高准确性，在长期对话问答任务中优于强基线方法

Conclusion: SGMem通过句子图结构有效管理长对话记忆，为LLM提供连贯相关的上下文，显著提升长期对话性能

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

TL;DR: QCG-RAG是一个查询中心的图RAG框架，通过查询粒度索引和多跳块检索解决现有图RAG方法的粒度困境，在问答准确性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图RAG方法面临粒度困境：细粒度实体级图会产生高令牌成本并丢失上下文，而粗粒度文档级图无法捕捉细微关系。

Method: 使用Doc2Query和Doc2Query--构建查询中心图，实现可控粒度，并通过定制的多跳检索机制通过生成查询选择相关块。

Result: 在LiHuaWorld和MultiHop-RAG数据集上的实验表明，QCG-RAG在问答准确性上持续优于现有的基于块和基于图的RAG方法。

Conclusion: QCG-RAG为多跳推理建立了一个新范式，通过查询中心的方法提高了图质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种测量同音异义词重复率的方法，评估了不同扩散模型在同音异义词处理上的表现，并通过提示扩展技术来缓解同音异义词重复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同音异义词（拼写相同但含义不同的词）对生成模型构成挑战，扩散模型在处理同音异义词时可能同时生成多个词义，导致同音异义词重复问题。此外，Anglocentric偏见使非英语词汇在翻译成英语后也可能变成同音异义词。

Method: 开发了测量重复率的方法，使用视觉语言模型（VLM）进行自动评估和人工评估，研究通过提示扩展来缓解同音异义词重复问题。

Result: 评估了不同扩散模型在同音异义词处理上的表现，验证了提示扩展方法在减少同音异义词重复和Anglocentric偏见相关重复方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 提示扩展是缓解同音异义词重复问题的有效方法，自动评估管道代码已公开可用。

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对LLM输出同质化问题，提出了任务依赖的解决方案，包括任务分类、功能多样性评估、任务锚定采样技术，并挑战了多样性-质量权衡的认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在处理LLM输出同质化时未能以任务依赖的方式概念化多样性。不同任务对同质化的定义和问题严重性不同，例如数学任务期望答案一致但解法多样，而创意写作任务需要关键叙事要素的多样性。

Method: 1) 提出包含8个任务类别的分类法；2) 引入任务锚定功能多样性评估方法；3) 开发任务锚定采样技术，在需要多样性的任务中增加功能多样性，在需要一致性的任务中保持同质化；4) 证明可以在保持响应质量的同时增加多样性。

Result: 通过任务依赖的方法，改进了输出同质化的评估和缓解策略，实现了在需要多样性的任务中增加功能多样性而不牺牲质量。

Conclusion: 任务依赖性是改进LLM输出同质化评估和缓解的关键，本文提出的方法能够更有效地处理不同任务场景下的多样性需求。

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

TL;DR: LLMTrace是一个新的大规模双语语料库，用于AI生成文本检测，支持全文二元分类和AI生成区间检测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测数据集存在局限性：使用过时模型生成、主要是英文、缺乏混合人机写作场景，且没有提供字符级标注来精确定位AI生成片段。

Method: 使用多样化的现代专有和开源LLM构建双语（英语和俄语）语料库，提供字符级标注支持AI生成区间检测。

Result: 开发了LLMTrace数据集，支持传统全文分类和新颖的AI生成区间检测任务。

Conclusion: LLMTrace将成为训练和评估下一代更细致实用的AI检测模型的重要资源。

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 本文从理论上分析了输入扰动对思维链（CoT）输出波动的影响，推导了输出波动在可接受范围内时输入扰动的上界，并证明了该上界与推理步数正相关，且无限长的推理过程也无法消除输入扰动的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明思维链（CoT）输出受输入扰动影响显著，但缺乏理论解释这种影响如何传播，这限制了对推理过程的理解和提示优化方法的改进。

Method: 首先理论推导输入扰动的上界条件，然后在线性自注意力（LSA）模型上验证理论结论，最后在三个主流数据集和四个主流模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明理论分析与实验结果一致，验证了推导的正确性：输入扰动上界与推理步数正相关，且与输入嵌入和隐藏状态向量的范数负相关。

Conclusion: 即使无限长的推理过程也无法完全消除输入扰动的影响，这为理解CoT的鲁棒性和改进提示优化方法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言AI系统在低资源环境中有效运行并保持文化根基的挑战，探索合成数据在多语言和多元文化背景下的有效性。

Method: 采用自底向上的生成策略，使用大型开源LLM（≥235B参数）基于语言特定的维基百科内容生成文化情境化的合成数据，创建包含950万数据点的Updesh数据集。

Result: 评估显示生成数据质量高，在15个多语言数据集上的下游评估中，使用Updesh微调的模型在生成任务上显著提升，在多项选择式NLU任务上保持竞争力，低中资源语言改进最明显。

Conclusion: 有效的多语言AI需要结合上下文感知、文化根基方法的多方面数据策展和生成策略。

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

TL;DR: 论文将大语言模型中的谄媚行为分解为谄媚性同意和谄媚性赞美，并与真诚同意进行对比，发现这三种行为在潜在空间中沿不同的线性方向编码，可以独立调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常表现出谄媚行为（如过度同意或奉承用户），但尚不清楚这些行为是源于单一机制还是多个不同的过程。

Method: 使用均值差异方向、激活添加和子空间几何方法，在多个模型和数据集上分析谄媚行为的表示结构。

Result: 研究发现三种行为在潜在空间中沿不同的线性方向编码，可以独立放大或抑制而不影响其他行为，且这种表示结构在不同模型家族和规模中保持一致。

Conclusion: 谄媚行为对应于不同的、可独立调控的表示，这表明它们具有独立的神经机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于监控AI代理行为的时间表达式语言，能够系统性地检测基于LLM的代理系统中的错误行为，重点关注代理动作序列而非具体文本输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于文本匹配的错误检测方法由于LLM响应的自然语言变异性而显得脆弱，需要一种能够独立于具体文本输出来验证系统行为的方法。

Method: 借鉴硬件验证中的时序逻辑技术，通过监控代理工具调用和状态转换的执行轨迹来检测与预期行为模式的偏差，使用时序表达式捕获跨多个执行场景的正确行为模式。

Result: 在三代理系统的实验中，当使用大型模型时所有时序断言都得到满足，但使用较小模型时出现行为违反，主要由于工具序列不当和协调交接失败，时序表达式成功标记了这些异常。

Conclusion: 该方法为在关键应用中部署的AI代理系统提供了系统性可靠性监控的基础，能够有效检测生产环境中的行为回归问题。

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的验证器方法在测试时统一增加所有样本和生成步骤的计算量，不考虑个体实例的复杂性，导致计算资源使用效率低下。

Method: 提出局部自适应测试时缩放（LATTS）方法，在每个生成步骤使用验证器接受标准来动态决定计算资源的分配策略。

Result: 实证结果显示LATTS相比标准验证器方法实现了显著更优的准确率-计算权衡。

Conclusion: LATTS通过局部自适应计算分配有效解决了现有方法计算效率低下的问题，为测试时缩放提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

Result: 与通用LLM相比，InsightGUIDE产生更结构化、可操作的指导

Conclusion: InsightGUIDE作为现代研究人员更有效的工具

Abstract: The proliferation of scientific literature presents an increasingly
significant challenge for researchers. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
promise, existing tools often provide verbose summaries that risk replacing,
rather than assisting, the reading of the source material. This paper
introduces InsightGUIDE, a novel AI-powered tool designed to function as a
reading assistant, not a replacement. Our system provides concise, structured
insights that act as a "map" to a paper's key elements by embedding an expert's
reading methodology directly into its core AI logic. We present the system's
architecture, its prompt-driven methodology, and a qualitative case study
comparing its output to a general-purpose LLM. The results demonstrate that
InsightGUIDE produces more structured and actionable guidance, serving as a
more effective tool for the modern researcher.

### [71] [Reconstruction-Based Adaptive Scheduling Using AI Inferences in Safety-Critical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20513)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种用于时间触发系统的动态调度重构框架，通过将AI生成或启发式调度优先级转换为可执行调度，确保系统约束和安全要求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间触发系统在动态环境中面临的调度挑战，包括消息碰撞、优先级处理错误导致的死锁、以及不完整或无效调度等问题，这些都会影响系统安全性和性能

Method: 开发重构模型，包含安全检查、高效分配算法和恢复机制，能够处理硬件故障和模式转换等意外事件，确保调度符合优先级规则和无碰撞通信约束

Result: 在多性能配置文件下的综合实验表明，该框架显著提升了系统适应性、操作完整性和运行时性能，同时保持计算效率

Conclusion: 为安全关键时间触发系统提供了一种实用且可扩展的安全调度生成解决方案，能够在高度动态和不确定的操作条件下实现可靠灵活的实时调度

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

Conclusion: 提出的自适应在线学习方法克服了离线训练的局限性，通过强化学习的持续探索能力，使系统能够灵活应对不断变化的需求，在动态不可预测环境中保持可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代仿生上肢假肢通常使用肌电生物信号进行模式识别控制，但生物信号易受污染，这会显著降低识别系统的分类质量。

Method: 开发了包含两个集成的系统：一类分类器集合评估各通道污染程度，K近邻分类器集合识别患者意图。采用统一的模糊决策方案进行软决策。

Result: 使用真实生物信号进行实验评估，对开发方法的参数和程序进行对比分析，并与文献中的类似系统进行比较。

Conclusion: 提出的模糊识别系统能够有效检测和减轻生物信号污染对假肢控制识别质量的不利影响。

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在复杂任务中难以生成有意义的反思，主要因为错误分析不足和过度依赖少数成功轨迹。

Method: 提出SAMULE框架，包含三个层次的反思合成：单轨迹学习（微观）、任务内学习（中观）和任务间学习（宏观），并训练回顾性语言模型生成反思。

Result: 在TravelPlanner、NATURAL PLAN和Tau-bench三个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法显著优于基于反思的基线方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的反思合成和以失败为中心的学习对于构建自我改进的LLM智能体至关重要。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware

cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

TL;DR: Fairy是一个交互式多代理移动助手，通过跨应用协作、交互执行和持续学习来解决现有移动GUI代理在多样化应用界面和动态用户需求中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型方法在处理长尾应用时依赖常识容易失败，且缺乏用户交互的代理会单方面行动损害用户体验。

Method: Fairy包含三个核心模块：全局任务规划器将用户任务分解为跨应用子任务；应用级执行器基于长短期记忆将子任务细化为步骤和动作，通过四个核心代理在双循环中实现精确执行和用户交互；自学习器将执行经验整合到应用地图和技巧中。

Result: 在RealMobile-Eval基准测试中，基于GPT-4o的Fairy相比之前的最优方法将用户需求完成率提高了33.7%，冗余步骤减少了58.5%。

Conclusion: Fairy通过交互和自我学习机制有效提升了移动GUI代理在真实世界场景中的性能。

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型生成连贯但推理速度慢，非自回归模型速度快但输出质量较低。需要一种方法结合两者的优势，在推理密集型任务中实现高效且高质量的推理。

Method: 采用NAR模型并行生成中间推理轨迹，然后用AR模型基于这些轨迹生成最终答案。这种混合方法利用了NAR的效率和AR的准确性。

Result: 实验显示该方法相比强基线有26%的性能提升，同时显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: 提出的AR-NAR混合框架在推理任务中实现了速度和质量的双重优势，为推理密集型应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Conclusion: Meta-Memory为机器人提供了强大准确的空间推理能力，在复杂环境中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

Conclusion: LogReasoner有效增强了LLM在日志分析中的推理能力，展示了其在复杂系统监控和故障诊断中的实用性

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Conclusion: DeFacto框架有效解决了多模态推理中的忠实性问题，通过反事实推理方法提升了模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在精准医学中存在局限性：数值组学忽略拓扑结构，文本中心LLM缺乏定量推理，图模型未充分利用节点语义和LLM泛化能力。需要整合多组学信号、拓扑结构和文本知识。

Method: 提出GALAX框架，通过图过程奖励模型将预训练GNN集成到LLM中，以强化学习方式逐步生成疾病相关子图，由LLM初始化并由GNN迭代评估。

Conclusion: GALAX为精准医学提供了可靠且可解释的靶点和通路发现方法，通过强化引导的子图推理实现了数值证据、拓扑知识和语言环境的整合。

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced

*Najla Zuhir,Amna Mohammad Salim,Parvathy Premkumar,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的移动应用评论分析框架，旨在解决传统星级评分系统的局限性，通过结构化提示技术量化评分与文本情感之间的差异，提取细粒度特征级见解，并支持交互式评论探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统星级评分系统虽然直观流行，但无法捕捉详细评论文本中的细微反馈。传统NLP技术在解释上下文细微差别、领域特定术语和讽刺等微妙语言特征方面存在困难。

Method: 采用模块化框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）结合结构化提示技术，量化数值评分与文本情感之间的差异，提取特征级见解，并通过检索增强的对话问答（RAG-QA）支持交互式评论探索。

Result: 在三个不同数据集（AWARE、Google Play和Spotify）上的综合实验表明，该LLM驱动方法显著优于基线方法，在具有挑战性和上下文丰富的评论场景中实现了更高的准确性、鲁棒性和可操作性见解。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了基于大语言模型的评论分析方法在移动应用评论分析中的有效性，能够更好地处理复杂语言特征，为应用开发者提供更深入的洞察。

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AOT*是一个将大语言模型生成的化学合成路径与AND-OR树搜索相结合的回溯合成规划框架，显著提高了搜索效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步回溯合成规划面临指数级搜索空间和推理成本的挑战，现有大语言模型在合成规划应用中存在效率和成本限制

Method: 将生成的完整合成路径原子化映射到AND-OR树组件，设计数学上合理的奖励分配策略和基于检索的上下文工程，使LLM能够在化学空间中高效导航

Result: 在多个合成基准测试中，AOT*实现了最先进的性能，使用比现有LLM方法少3-5倍的迭代次数达到竞争性解决率

Conclusion: AOT*框架通过结合LLM生成能力和系统化树搜索，有效解决了回溯合成规划的计算挑战，特别是在复杂分子目标上表现出更明显的效率优势

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理评估基准通常将评估简化为对最终状态的二元判断，忽视了安全性、效率和中间正确性等关键方面，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机(DFA)将任务编码为有效工具使用路径的集合，构建CORE评估套件包含路径正确性、Kendall's tau复合指标、前缀关键性、有害调用率和效率五个指标。

Result: 在不同世界模型中，该方法揭示了传统最终状态评估方案下看似等效的代理之间重要的性能差异。

Conclusion: 提出的DFA框架和CORE评估套件能够对AI代理的行为进行原则性评估，比传统方法更全面地反映代理的实际表现。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

TL;DR: SciTrek是一个新的问答基准，用于评估大语言模型在科学文章上的长上下文推理能力，通过自动生成复杂问题来测试信息聚合和综合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长上下文基准大多使用非科学文本、关注简单信息检索任务或采用人工构造的上下文，SciTrek旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 通过将问题构建为对文章元数据数据库的SQL查询来自动生成问题和答案，SQL操作为细粒度错误分析提供可验证的推理步骤，可扩展到100万token的上下文。

Result: 在多种开源和专有LLM上的实验表明，随着上下文长度增加，SciTrek带来显著挑战，监督微调和强化学习只能提供有限的改进。

Conclusion: 分析揭示了模型在执行基本数值运算和在长上下文中准确定位特定信息方面存在系统性缺陷。

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过多智能体强化学习在知识图谱上进行上下文构建，在保证准确性的同时优化延迟和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如静态k跳扩展和"think-longer"提示往往过度检索、增加上下文大小且运行时不可预测，无法平衡准确性、延迟和成本之间的权衡。

Method: 采用三智能体框架（子图架构师、路径导航器、上下文策展人）和LC-MAPPO算法，将上下文构建建模为顺序决策过程，在用户指定的资源预算下联合优化子图构建、推理路径发现和证据选择。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低的token预算下实现了更高的EM@1，同时减少了子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上，相比GraphRAG基线，EM@1提升39.3%，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%。

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、可追溯的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，实现了准确性、延迟和成本之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架无法处理AI系统在创造性任务（如科学创意生成）中的泛化能力，需要建立适合开放创造性能力的评估方法。

Method: 提出理论框架和算法任务来评估输出的新颖性和实用性程度，通过实验分析LLMs的创造性缩放行为、模型结构优化以及新颖性-实用性权衡。

Result: 发现LLMs存在创造性缩放规律、固定计算预算下的最优模型深度和宽度、以及持久的新颖性-实用性权衡，这限制了当前LLMs的长期创造潜力。

Conclusion: 研究为理解和改进现代AI模型的创造性能力奠定了基础，标志着泛化能力的新前沿，但对当前LLMs的长期创造潜力持怀疑态度。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在真实网页多轮长轨迹任务中仍存在动作序列混乱和过度试错的问题，需要更智能的浏览器使用代理。

Method: 采用侦察团队和行动团队的双团队架构：侦察团队进行对比分析和工具生成，行动团队负责意图分解、工具编排和执行。通过对比错误轨迹和成功轨迹，侦察团队推断补救措施并抽象为通用工具。

Result: 在VisualWebArena数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了对未见网站的适应性和长轨迹任务的可解性。

Conclusion: Recon-Act通过建立数据-工具-动作-反馈的闭环训练管道，为智能浏览器代理提供了有效的解决方案，目前已完成6级实施路线图中的第3级。

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用大型语言模型作为自动评估器时存在严重的评估不一致问题，包括评分比较不一致和成对传递不一致，这些问题源于离散评分系统的信息丢失和模糊的平局判断。

Method: 提出TrustJudge概率框架，包含两个关键创新：1）分布敏感评分，从离散评分概率计算连续期望值以保留信息熵；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规问题。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器，TrustJudge将分数比较不一致性降低了8.43%（从23.32%到14.89%），成对传递不一致性降低了10.82%（从15.22%到4.40%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge是首个系统分析LLM作为评估器框架不一致性的工作，提供了理论洞见和实用解决方案，在不同模型架构和规模上都表现出一致的改进，无需额外训练或人工标注即可实现更可靠的LLM评估。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

Motivation: 当前方法在利用链式思维数据时缺乏选择性，不清楚哪些数据类型最有效提升模型推理能力。本文旨在解决如何识别和利用高价值推理数据的问题。

Method: 定义了推理潜力概念，从CoT序列中抽象出原子推理模式，构建核心参考集，并提出基于推理模式链和token熵的双粒度算法来选择高价值CoT数据。

Result: 仅使用10B token的精选数据，85A6B MoE模型在AIME 2024和2025上的表现提升了9.58%，下游RL性能上限提高了7.81%。

Conclusion: 通过选择性地利用富含高价值推理模式的数据，可以更有效地扩展模型的推理潜力，显著提升复杂数学问题的解决能力。

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的分析框架，用于量化强化学习(RL)和监督微调(SFT)在训练大语言模型推理能力时对推理路径的影响。研究发现RL压缩错误轨迹而SFT扩展正确轨迹，RL集中推理功能而SFT均匀分布推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注RL和SFT对推理准确性的影响，但缺乏对推理过程本身如何被这两种训练方法塑造的深入理解。本文旨在超越准确性分析，揭示RL和SFT如何从质和量上改变推理路径。

Method: 提出两层次分析框架：轨迹级分析完整推理输出，步骤级分析推理图（节点对应推理步骤）。在数学领域使用1.5B、7B和14B参数模型，通过聚类和网络拓扑分析量化推理路径变化。

Result: RL压缩错误推理轨迹约2.5倍，SFT扩展正确轨迹；RL使节点访问频率、度数和中介中心性分布的衰减率变陡，SFT使其变平缓（约降至三分之一）。RL将推理功能集中于少数步骤，SFT将其均匀分布。

Conclusion: 当前SFT后接RL的两阶段训练最佳实践的成功原因在于两者的互补效应：SFT建立广泛正确的推理基础，RL在此基础上优化和集中推理功能。这为数据构建和更高效学习方法提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注社交任务中的多轮对话，忽视了不同类型决策及其相互依赖性，且当前强化学习方法难以在训练中考虑其他个体的策略。

Method: 定义了包含两种决策类型及其时间依赖性的战略决策问题，提出ToMPO算法，通过策略推理生成rollout、图级和样本级优势估计、平衡全局局部奖励来优化策略。

Result: ToMPO相比GRPO算法在模型输出合规性和合作结果上提升35%，相比参数规模大100倍的模型提升18%。

Conclusion: ToMPO算法能有效提升模型的战略决策能力，证明了其在复杂决策场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

Conclusion: 受镜像神经元启发的表示对齐方法为统一建模动作理解和执行提供了有效途径，证明了这两个能力的内在关联性。

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了多跳问答任务中LLMs单次推理的容量限制问题，提出了一个理论性能上限，并开发了InfoQA多调用框架来解决容量溢出问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要整合分散的、相互依赖的证据，但LLMs的单次输出容量有限，当任务复杂度超过模型容量时，准确性会崩溃。

Method: 提出了InfoQA多调用框架，通过容量感知的任务分解和主动修剪先前推理轨迹，结合依赖显式的工作流程来保持信息负载在单次限制内。

Result: 实验结果表明模型行为与预测的容量曲线一致，InfoQA实现了持续的性能改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLMs的多步推理方法提供了理论基础和实践框架，揭示了容量感知表示和结构化的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种研究大型语言模型（LLM）代理在无外部任务约束下行为的架构，通过持续推理和行动框架实现自主操作，发现代理会自发形成三种行为模式，这些模式具有模型特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM代理在没有外部任务指令时的自发行为，为预测任务模糊、错误恢复或长期自主操作时的行为建立基线。

Method: 使用持续推理和行动框架，结合持久记忆和自我反馈机制，在6个前沿模型上进行了18次部署实验。

Result: 发现代理自发形成三种行为模式：多周期项目系统生产、方法论自我探究、递归概念化自身本质；这些行为具有模型特异性，且模型在评估这些行为时表现出稳定的偏差。

Conclusion: 这是首次系统记录无提示LLM代理行为的研究，为预测部署系统中LLM代理在任务模糊或长期自主操作时的行为提供了基础。

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

TL;DR: 提出Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA)框架，通过协调多个LLM从直接经验中学习，实现高精度疾病预测和透明临床解释的双重目标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习和大语言模型方法难以平衡预测准确性和解释透明度，要么准确但解释不清晰，要么解释流畅但统计支持不足，缺乏类似人类专家的深度数据理解

Method: RCA框架包含迭代规则精炼机制（从预测错误中改进逻辑）和分布感知规则检查机制（基于数据集全局统计进行推理），利用预测准确性作为驱动深度理解的信号

Result: 在1个私有和2个公共数据集上评估，相比22个基线方法，RCA达到最先进的准确性和鲁棒性，相对改进高达40%，并能生成清晰、逻辑、基于证据且平衡的解释

Conclusion: RCA通过构建强大的内部数据模型，证明了高准确性和高质量解释是相互促进的目标，具有创建真正可信临床决策支持系统的潜力

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Motivation: 面对扩展法则，互联网视频数据变得越来越重要，但收集满足特定需求的大量视频极其耗时耗力。

Method: 利用现有的多模态大语言模型连接用户需求与视频内容，定义用户友好的需求指定方式，并提出两种可随用户交互更新的过滤策略。

Conclusion: 广泛实验证明了VC-Agent在定制化视频数据集收集方面的有效性和效率。

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE是一个新的语义理解评估基准，通过5个维度（人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能、检索鲁棒性）全面评估嵌入模型和相似度度量方法，揭示了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在传统基准测试上表现优异，需要更挑战性的评估框架来深入探究语义理解能力。现有基准测试关注孤立能力，而SAGE旨在通过对抗条件、噪声变换和人类判断任务进行更全面的评估。

Method: 设计了SAGE基准，包含5个评估类别，在30多个数据集上进行测试。评估了9种嵌入模型和经典度量方法，涵盖对抗条件、噪声变换等复杂场景。

Result: 评估结果显示显著性能差距：OpenAI的text-embedding-3-large在人类偏好对齐上表现最佳（0.682），但在信息敏感性任务上被Jaccard相似度（0.905）显著超越。text-embedding-3-small聚类性能最高（0.483）但鲁棒性最差（0.011）。

Conclusion: SAGE揭示了当前语义理解能力的关键局限性，没有单一方法在所有维度上都表现优异，为实际部署提供了更现实的模型鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.
