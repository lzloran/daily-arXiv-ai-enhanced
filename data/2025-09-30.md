### [1] [Are you sure? Measuring models bias in content moderation through uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22699)
*Alessandra Urbinati,Mirko Lai,Simona Frenda,Marco Antonio Stranisci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于不确定性的无监督方法来评估内容审核模型对弱势群体的偏见，使用保形预测技术计算模型置信度，发现某些模型对少数群体预测准确但置信度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在内容审核中存在种族和社会偏见问题，现有基于性能的指标难以有效衡量模型公平性，需要开发新的偏见评估方法。

Method: 使用保形预测技术计算模型不确定性，将其作为偏见代理指标，评估11个模型对女性和非白人注释者的偏见程度。

Result: 结果显示某些预训练模型对少数群体预测准确率高但置信度低，通过测量模型置信度可以识别哪些注释者群体在模型中代表性更好。

Conclusion: 通过测量模型置信度能够揭示预训练模型中的群体代表性差异，为模型去偏过程提供指导，确保模型在正式使用前得到去偏处理。

Abstract: Automatic content moderation is crucial to ensuring safety in social media.
Language Model-based classifiers are being increasingly adopted for this task,
but it has been shown that they perpetuate racial and social biases. Even if
several resources and benchmark corpora have been developed to challenge this
issue, measuring the fairness of models in content moderation remains an open
issue. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models
on the basis of their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by people
belonging to vulnerable groups. We use uncertainty, computed by means of the
conformal prediction technique, as a proxy to analyze the bias of 11 models
against women and non-white annotators and observe to what extent it diverges
from metrics based on performance, such as the $F_1$ score. The results show
that some pre-trained models predict with high accuracy the labels coming from
minority groups, even if the confidence in their prediction is low. Therefore,
by measuring the confidence of models, we are able to see which groups of
annotators are better represented in pre-trained models and lead the debiasing
process of these models before their effective use.

### [2] [AccessEval: Benchmarking Disability Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22703)
*Srikant Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AccessEval基准评估了21个闭源和开源LLM在6个现实领域和9种残疾类型上的表现，发现对残疾相关查询的回应更负面、刻板印象更强、事实错误更多，反映了模型行为中根深蒂固的健全主义偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统研究LLM在不同残疾情境下处理现实查询的差异，揭示模型行为中存在的健全主义偏见及其对残疾用户的实际影响。

Method: 使用AccessEval基准，通过中性查询和残疾意识查询配对，评估21个LLM在6个领域和9种残疾类型上的表现，采用情感、社会感知和事实准确性指标。

Result: 残疾意识查询的回应语气更负面，刻板印象增加，事实错误率更高，这些影响在听力、言语和行动障碍方面尤为明显。

Conclusion: LLM中存在的健全主义偏见可能对残疾用户造成实际伤害，强调了在日常应用中减轻偏见的重要性，数据集已公开提供。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains
but often exhibit disparities in how they handle real-life queries. To
systematically investigate these effects within various disability contexts, we
introduce \textbf{AccessEval (Accessibility Evaluation)}, a benchmark
evaluating 21 closed- and open-source LLMs across 6 real-world domains and 9
disability types using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware Queries. We
evaluated model outputs with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and
factual accuracy.
  Our analysis reveals that responses to disability-aware queries tend to have
a more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual error compared
to neutral queries. These effects show notable variation by domain and
disability type, with disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and mobility
disproportionately impacted. These disparities reflect persistent forms of
ableism embedded in model behavior.
  By examining model performance in real-world decision-making contexts, we
better illuminate how such biases can translate into tangible harms for
disabled users. This framing helps bridges the gap between technical evaluation
and user impact, reinforcing importance of bias mitigation in day-to-day
applications. Our dataset is publicly available at:

### [3] [RAR$^2$: Retrieval-Augmented Medical Reasoning via Thought-Driven Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22713)
*Kaishuai Xu,Wenjun Hou,Yi Cheng,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RAR²框架，通过联合学习改进推理增强检索和检索增强推理，在医学问答任务中优于现有RAG方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理需要深度推理的复杂医学问题时表现不佳，因为表面级输入无法反映任务真实的知识需求，且缺乏对推理过程的显式建模

Method: 构建思维过程揭示隐含知识需求，使用混合偏好对数据集，应用DPO训练模型，并设计两种测试时扩展策略

Result: 在多个生物医学问答数据集上的实验表明，RAR²优于有或无微调的RAG基线方法

Conclusion: RAR²框架通过联合优化推理和检索过程，有效提升了复杂医学问题的处理能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on diverse
medical benchmarks, highlighting their potential in supporting real-world
clinical tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key
approach for mitigating knowledge gaps and hallucinations by incorporating
external medical information. However, RAG still struggles with complex medical
questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails
to reflect the true knowledge needs of the task. Existing methods typically
focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process,
limiting their ability to retrieve and integrate clinically relevant knowledge.
In this work, we propose RAR$^2$, a joint learning framework that improves both
Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. RAR$^2$
constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and
uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. We build a training dataset
of mixed preference pairs and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to
train the model. Moreover, we design two test-time scaling strategies to
explore the boundaries of our framework. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAR$^2$ across several biomedical question answering datasets,
outperforming RAG baselines with or without fine-tuning.

### [4] [TRUEBench: Can LLM Response Meet Real-world Constraints as Productivity Assistant?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22715)
*Jiho Park,Jongyoon Song,Minjin Choi,Kyuho Heo,Taehun Huh,Ji Won Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRUEBench是一个专为LLM生产力助手设计的新基准测试，通过12种语言的输入提示、多轮对话场景和严格评估标准，更真实地评估模型的实际指令遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLM真实世界指令遵循能力方面存在不足：缺乏多语言支持、未能捕捉用户请求中的隐式约束、忽视多轮对话复杂性。

Method: 设计TRUEBench基准，包含12种语言的输入提示、多语言指令、严格评估标准（显式和隐式约束）、复杂多轮对话场景（累积约束和上下文切换），并使用LLM验证器优化约束。

Result: TRUEBench比现有基准更具挑战性，即使是强模型如OpenAI o1也仅获得69.07%的总体通过率。

Conclusion: TRUEBench为LLM在实用生产力场景中提供了严格且真实的评估，突出了模型的能力和局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral as productivity
assistants, but existing benchmarks fall short in rigorously evaluating their
real-world instruction-following capabilities. Current benchmarks often (i)
lack sufficient multilinguality, (ii) fail to capture the implicit constraints
inherent in user requests, and (iii) overlook the complexities of multi-turn
dialogue. To address these critical gaps and provide a more realistic
assessment, we introduce TRUEBench (Trustworthy Real-world Usage Evaluation
Benchmark)1, a novel benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based productivity
assistants. TRUEBench distinguishes itself by featuring input prompts across 12
languages, incorporating intra-instance multilingual instructions, employing
rigorous evaluation criteria to capture both explicit and implicit constraints,
and including complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with both accumulating
constraints and context switches. Furthermore, to ensure reliability in
evaluation, we refined constraints using an LLM validator. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TRUEBench presents significantly greater
challenges than existing benchmarks; for instance, a strong model like OpenAI
o1 achieved only a 69.07% overall pass rate. TRUEBench offers a demanding and
realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, highlighting
their capabilities and limitations.

### [5] [Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis with Dynamic Attention Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22729)
*Sadia Abdulhalim,Muaz Albaghdadi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic Attention Fusion (DAF)框架，通过自适应注意力机制融合文本和语音特征，在无需微调编码器的情况下显著提升多模态情感分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态情感分析仅依赖文本，忽略了语音语调等非语言线索对情感意图理解的重要性。

Method: 使用冻结的预训练语言模型文本嵌入和语音编码器声学特征，通过自适应注意力机制为每个话语动态加权不同模态。

Result: 在大型多模态基准测试中持续优于静态融合和单模态基线，F1分数显著提升，预测误差降低。消融研究证实动态加权策略对建模复杂情感输入至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过有效整合语言和非语言信息，为情感预测提供了更鲁棒的基础，对情感计算应用具有广泛影响。

Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis has long been a unimodal task, relying solely
on text. This approach overlooks non-verbal cues such as vocal tone and prosody
that are essential for capturing true emotional intent. We introduce Dynamic
Attention Fusion (DAF), a lightweight framework that combines frozen text
embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a
speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality
per utterance. Without any finetuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed
DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on
a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and
reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that
support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for
modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and
non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for
sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing
applications -- from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more
natural human computer interaction.

### [6] [Enabling Approximate Joint Sampling in Diffusion LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22738)
*Parikshit Bansal,Sujay Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种在扩散语言模型中近似联合采样的方法，通过轻量级采样器层在单个全模型前向传递中生成多个token，平衡生成质量与速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型按顺序采样token，确保从正确联合分布中采样，而扩散语言模型并行解掩码token会导致偏离真实联合分布，影响生成质量但提升速度。

Method: 在现有大型扩散LM上添加轻量级单层采样器，全模型前向传递后仅使用采样器层进行多次前向传递来生成多个解掩码token，采样器训练用于模拟冻结全模型的精确联合采样。

Result: 在预训练和指令调优模型上验证有效性，当每个去噪步骤解掩码4个token时，MAUVE分数达到0.87（相比边际基线0.31），接近真实联合分布。

Conclusion: 提出的近似联合采样方法在保持生成速度的同时显著提高了扩散语言模型的生成质量，使其更接近真实联合分布。

Abstract: In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on
all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked
diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and
potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking
in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the
further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the
resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a
way to {\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution
in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight
single-layer ``sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward
pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only
this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained
to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the
effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only
(Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language
modeling and math \& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each
full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of
0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint
distribution.

### [7] [Painless Activation Steering: An Automated, Lightweight Approach for Post-Training Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22739)
*Sasha Cui,Zhongren Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PAS（无痛激活引导）方法，这是一种完全自动化的激活引导技术，无需人工干预即可使用任何标注数据集来引导语言模型的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的权重调整方法耗时昂贵，提示工程方法难以精确控制且需要人工试错，而现有激活引导技术需要手工构建提示对或特征标注，使用不便。

Method: PAS通过完全自动化的方式构建激活向量，无需提示构建、特征标注或人工干预，可以直接使用任何标注数据集进行训练。

Result: 在3个开源模型和18个任务上的评估显示，PAS能可靠提升行为任务性能，但对智能导向任务无效。iPAS变体在偏见、道德和对齐任务上分别提升10.1%、5.2%和34.8%。

Conclusion: PAS提供了一种快速、轻量级的激活向量构建方法，可作为实用的自动化语言模型后训练选项，并明确了激活引导技术的适用场景和局限性。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and
behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is
time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and
often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises
a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training
methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or
labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the
plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of
fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled
dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human
intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models
(Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks;
we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for
intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the
strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8%
on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context
Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector
that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results
provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy
it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.

### [8] [MIRAGE: Multi-hop Reasoning with Ambiguity Evaluation for Illusory Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22750)
*Jeonghyun Park,Ingeol Baek,Seunghyun Yoon,Haeun Jang,Aparna Garimella,Akriti Jain,Nedim Lipka,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MIRAGE基准测试，用于评估多跳问答中的歧义处理能力，并开发了CLARION多智能体框架来解决这一挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多跳问答往往涉及与推理过程密不可分的歧义性，这种歧义性导致从单个问题中产生多个推理路径，每个路径都需要独立解决，而现有大语言模型在此类问题上表现不佳。

Method: 构建了包含1,142个高质量歧义多跳问题的MIRAGE基准测试，采用多LLM验证流程进行严格筛选，并提出CLARION多智能体框架来明确歧义并进行推理。

Result: 实验表明，即使是当前最先进的模型在MIRAGE基准测试上也表现不佳，而CLARION框架显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 解决歧义性与多步推理的结合是一个独特且重要的挑战，CLARION框架为开发更自适应和鲁棒的推理系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Real-world Multi-hop Question Answering (QA) often involves ambiguity that is
inseparable from the reasoning process itself. This ambiguity creates a
distinct challenge, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from a single
question, each requiring independent resolution. Since each sub-question is
ambiguous, the model must resolve ambiguity at every step. Thus, answering a
single question requires handling multiple layers of ambiguity throughout the
reasoning chain. We find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in
this setting, typically exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing
incomplete answers. To facilitate research on multi-hop ambiguity, we introduce
MultI-hop Reasoning with AmbiGuity Evaluation for Illusory Questions (MIRAGE),
a benchmark designed to analyze and evaluate this challenging intersection of
ambiguity interpretation and multi-hop reasoning. MIRAGE contains 1,142
high-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions, categorized under a
taxonomy of syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity, and curated through a
rigorous multi-LLM verification pipeline. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art models struggle on MIRAGE, confirming that resolving ambiguity
combined with multi-step inference is a distinct and significant challenge. To
establish a robust baseline, we propose CLarifying Ambiguity with a Reasoning
and InstructiON (CLARION), a multi-agent framework that significantly
outperforms existing approaches on MIRAGE, paving the way for more adaptive and
robust reasoning systems.

### [9] [ML2B: Multi-Lingual ML Benchmark For AutoML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22768)
*Ekaterina Trofimova,Zosia Shamina,Maria Selifanova,Artem Zaitsev,Remi Savchuk,Maxim Minets,Daria Ozerova,Emil Sataev,Denis Zuenko,Andrey E. Ustyuzhanin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ML2B，首个用于评估多语言机器学习代码生成的基准，包含30个Kaggle竞赛任务，翻译成13种自然语言，涵盖表格、文本和图像数据类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习代码生成基准主要局限于英语，忽视了机器学习研究和实践的全球性和多语言特性。

Method: 构建ML2B基准，包含30个Kaggle竞赛任务的多语言翻译，使用AIDE自动化框架进行端到端数据科学管道评估。

Result: 结果显示在非英语任务上性能下降15-45%，突显了多语言表示学习在代码生成中的关键挑战。

Conclusion: ML2B基准和评估框架为多语言机器学习代码生成研究提供了重要工具，揭示了当前模型在多语言环境下的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
in generating machine learning (ML) code, enabling end-to-end pipeline
construction from natural language instructions. However, existing benchmarks
for ML code generation are mainly restricted to English, overlooking the global
and multilingual nature of ML research and practice. To address this gap, we
present ML2B, the first benchmark for evaluating multilingual ML code
generation. ML2B consists of 30 Kaggle competitions translated into 13 natural
languages, covering tabular, text, and image data types, with structured
metadata and validated human-reviewed translations. For evaluation, we employ
AIDE, an automated framework for end-to-end assessment of data science
pipelines, and provide insights into cross-lingual model performance. Our
results reveal substantial 15-45% performance degradation on non-English tasks,
highlighting critical challenges in multilingual representation learning for
code generation. The benchmark, evaluation framework, and comprehensive results
are made available through our GitHub repository to facilitate future research
in multilingual ML code generation: https://github.com/enaix/ml2b.

### [10] [ArFake: A Multi-Dialect Benchmark and Baselines for Arabic Spoof-Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22808)
*Mohamed Maged,Alhassan Ehab,Ali Mekky,Besher Hassan,Shady Shehata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究创建了首个多方言阿拉伯语伪造语音数据集，通过评估多种文本转语音模型在阿拉伯语语音克隆上的表现，发现FishSpeech模型在Casablanca语料库上表现最佳，能生成更真实和具有挑战性的合成语音样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式文本转语音模型的兴起，区分真实和合成语音变得困难，特别是对于研究较少的阿拉伯语及其多种方言。大多数伪造检测研究集中在英语上，阿拉伯语存在显著研究空白。

Method: 构建多方言阿拉伯语伪造语音数据集，通过评估流水线比较多种TTS模型：使用嵌入方法和分类器头训练分类器；将经典机器学习算法应用于MFCC特征；使用RawNet2架构；计算基于人类评分的平均意见得分；通过自动语音识别模型处理原始和合成数据集以测量词错误率。

Result: FishSpeech在Casablanca语料库的阿拉伯语语音克隆中优于其他TTS模型，能生成更真实和具有挑战性的合成语音样本。

Conclusion: FishSpeech在阿拉伯语语音克隆方面表现最佳，但仅依赖单一TTS模型进行数据集创建可能会限制泛化能力。

Abstract: With the rise of generative text-to-speech models, distinguishing between
real and synthetic speech has become challenging, especially for Arabic that
have received limited research attention. Most spoof detection efforts have
focused on English, leaving a significant gap for Arabic and its many dialects.
In this work, we introduce the first multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech
dataset. To evaluate the difficulty of the synthesized audio from each model
and determine which produces the most challenging samples, we aimed to guide
the construction of our final dataset either by merging audios from multiple
models or by selecting the best-performing model, we conducted an evaluation
pipeline that included training classifiers using two approaches: modern
embedding-based methods combined with classifier heads; classical machine
learning algorithms applied to MFCC features; and the RawNet2 architecture. The
pipeline further incorporated the calculation of Mean Opinion Score based on
human ratings, as well as processing both original and synthesized datasets
through an Automatic Speech Recognition model to measure the Word Error Rate.
Our results demonstrate that FishSpeech outperforms other TTS models in Arabic
voice cloning on the Casablanca corpus, producing more realistic and
challenging synthetic speech samples. However, relying on a single TTS for
dataset creation may limit generalizability.

### [11] [EditGRPO: Reinforcement Learning with Post -Rollout Edits for Clinically Accurate Chest X-Ray Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22812)
*Kai Zhang,Christopher Malon,Lichao Sun,Martin Renqiang Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EditGRPO是一种混合策略强化学习算法，通过临床动机奖励优化放射学报告生成，在多个数据集上显著提升性能并表现出优越的跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在放射学报告生成中的监督微调目标与临床效果未明确对齐，需要更有效的优化方法。

Method: 提出EditGRPO混合策略强化学习算法，结合在线策略探索和离线策略指导，在训练过程中注入句子级详细修正。

Result: 在四个主要胸部X光报告数据集上，EditGRPO相比SFT和普通GRPO基线平均提升3.4%的评估指标，在未见数据集上平均提升5.9%。

Conclusion: EditGRPO通过临床奖励驱动的强化学习有效提升了放射学报告生成的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Radiology report generation requires advanced medical image analysis,
effective temporal reasoning, and accurate text generation. Although recent
innovations, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), have shown
improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not
explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO,
a mixed-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed specifically to
optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO
integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting
sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy
approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues
typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM initialized with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO
baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4% in CheXbert, GREEN,
Radgraph, and RATEScore metrics across four major chest X-ray report generation
datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain
generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9% on unseen datasets.

### [12] [Critique-Coder: Enhancing Coder Models by Critique Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22824)
*Chi Ruan,Dongfu Jiang,Yubo Wang,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL)方法，通过让模型对(问题，解决方案)对生成批评，仅基于最终判断标签是否与真实标签一致来给予奖励，并开发了Critique-Coder模型，在代码生成和一般推理任务上均优于仅使用RL的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习主要关注生成响应，缺乏显式培养批评或反思的机制。受Critique-Fine-Tuning和Critique-Guided-Distillation等研究启发，需要开发能显式教导LLMs如何进行批评的方法。

Method: 提出Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL)，模型任务是为给定(问题，解决方案)对生成批评，奖励仅基于最终判断标签是否与真实标签一致。开发Critique-Coder模型，将20%标准RL数据替换为CRL数据进行混合训练。

Result: Critique-Coder在所有评估基准上持续优于仅使用RL的基线模型。Critique-Coder-8B在LiveCodeBench(v5)上达到60%以上，优于DeepCoder-14B和GPT-o1。在BBEH数据集的逻辑推理任务上也表现更好，表明CRL在编码数据集上的应用能增强一般推理和批评能力。

Conclusion: CRL作为标准RL的很好补充，能增强LLM的推理能力，且这种能力可迁移到广泛任务中。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm,
particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily
focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster
critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT)
and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly
teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique
Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a
critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely
by whether the final judgment label $c \in \{\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}\}$
of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment $c^*$. Building
on this point, we introduce \textsc{Critique-Coder}, which is trained on a
hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\% of the standard RL data with CRL
data. We fine-tune multiple models (\textsc{Critique-Coder}) and evaluate them
on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show
that \textsc{Critique-Coder} consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all
the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our \textsc{Critique-Coder-8B} can reach
over 60\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like
DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, \textsc{Critique-Coder} also
demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better
performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that
the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and
critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks.
Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM
reasoning.

### [13] [ChatInject: Abusing Chat Templates for Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22830)
*Hwan Chang,Yonghyun Jun,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatInject是一种针对LLM代理的新型攻击方法，通过模仿原生聊天模板格式和多轮对话策略，显著提高了间接提示注入攻击的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于LLM的代理与外部环境交互的部署增加，出现了新的攻击面。传统研究主要关注纯文本注入攻击，但LLM对结构化聊天模板的依赖及其在上下文操纵中的脆弱性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ChatInject攻击，将恶意载荷格式化为模仿原生聊天模板的形式，利用模型的指令遵循倾向。开发了基于说服的多轮变体，通过多轮对话引导代理接受可疑操作。

Result: 在多个前沿LLM上的实验显示：(1)ChatInject攻击成功率显著高于传统方法，在AgentDojo上从5.18%提升至32.05%，在InjecAgent上从15.13%提升至45.90%，多轮对话在InjecAgent上达到52.33%成功率；(2)聊天模板载荷具有强跨模型迁移性，对闭源LLM也有效；(3)现有防御方法对此攻击基本无效。

Conclusion: 当前代理系统存在严重漏洞，ChatInject攻击暴露了LLM在结构化模板和多轮对话上下文中的安全脆弱性。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language model (LLM) based agents that
interact with external environments has created new attack surfaces for
adversarial manipulation. One major threat is indirect prompt injection, where
attackers embed malicious instructions in external environment output, causing
agents to interpret and execute them as if they were legitimate prompts. While
previous research has focused primarily on plain-text injection attacks, we
find a significant yet underexplored vulnerability: LLMs' dependence on
structured chat templates and their susceptibility to contextual manipulation
through persuasive multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we introduce ChatInject,
an attack that formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates,
thereby exploiting the model's inherent instruction-following tendencies.
Building on this foundation, we develop a persuasion-driven Multi-turn variant
that primes the agent across conversational turns to accept and execute
otherwise suspicious actions. Through comprehensive experiments across frontier
LLMs, we demonstrate three critical findings: (1) ChatInject achieves
significantly higher average attack success rates than traditional prompt

*Kai Hua,Zhiyuan Feng,Chongyang Tao,Rui Yan,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RSM-DCK模型，通过检测上下文和知识库中的相关部分来改进多轮对话响应选择，避免无用信息干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索式对话系统将所有上下文和知识内容用于匹配响应候选，但其中许多无用信息会影响匹配效果，需要识别相关部分。

Method: 使用最近上下文作为查询，在词级和话语级语义上预选相关上下文和知识；让响应候选分别与选定的上下文和知识交互；最后利用上下文和响应候选的融合表示更自信地后选相关知识进行匹配。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上测试，模型性能优于现有方法，能有效检测相关上下文和知识用于响应选择。

Conclusion: RSM-DCK模型通过检测上下文和知识的相关部分，显著提升了多轮对话响应选择的性能。

Abstract: Recently, knowledge-grounded conversations in the open domain gain great
attention from researchers. Existing works on retrieval-based dialogue systems
have paid tremendous efforts to utilize neural networks to build a matching
model, where all of the context and knowledge contents are used to match the
response candidate with various representation methods. Actually, different
parts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing
the proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic
shift. Those excessive useless information in the context and knowledge can
influence the matching process and leads to inferior performance. To address
this problem, we propose a multi-turn \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}election
\textbf{M}odel that can \textbf{D}etect the relevant parts of the
\textbf{C}ontext and \textbf{K}nowledge collection (\textbf{RSM-DCK}). Our
model first uses the recent context as a query to pre-select relevant parts of
the context and knowledge collection at the word-level and utterance-level
semantics. Further, the response candidate interacts with the selected context
and knowledge collection respectively. In the end, The fused representation of
the context and response candidate is utilized to post-select the relevant
parts of the knowledge collection more confidently for matching. We test our
proposed model on two benchmark datasets. Evaluation results indicate that our
model achieves better performance than the existing methods, and can
effectively detect the relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

### [15] [Towards Generalizable Implicit In-Context Learning with Attention Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22854)
*Jiaqian Li,Yanshu Li,Ligong Han,Ruixiang Tang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为In-Context Routing (ICR)的新型隐式上下文学习方法，通过在注意力对数层面内化可泛化的ICL模式，实现零样本成本下的少样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式ICL方法主要依赖向残差流注入偏移向量，这些向量通常从标记演示或任务特定对齐构建，未能充分利用ICL的结构机制且泛化能力有限。

Method: ICR提取ICL过程中出现的可重用结构方向，并采用可学习的输入条件路由器来相应调整注意力对数，实现一次训练多次使用的框架。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集上的评估显示，ICR始终优于需要任务特定检索或训练的先前隐式ICL方法，并在现有方法难以处理的域外任务上表现出鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: ICR有望推动ICL实用价值的边界扩展。

Abstract: Implicit in-context learning (ICL) has newly emerged as a promising paradigm
that simulates ICL behaviors in the representation space of Large Language
Models (LLMs), aiming to attain few-shot performance at zero-shot cost.
However, existing approaches largely rely on injecting shift vectors into
residual flows, which are typically constructed from labeled demonstrations or
task-specific alignment. Such designs fall short of utilizing the structural
mechanisms underlying ICL and suffer from limited generalizability. To address
this, we propose In-Context Routing (ICR), a novel implicit ICL method that
internalizes generalizable ICL patterns at the attention logits level. It
extracts reusable structural directions that emerge during ICL and employs a
learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits accordingly,
enabling a train-once-and-reuse framework. We evaluate ICR on 12 real-world
datasets spanning diverse domains and multiple LLMs. The results show that ICR
consistently outperforms prior implicit ICL methods that require task-specific
retrieval or training, while demonstrating robust generalization to
out-of-domain tasks where existing methods struggle. These findings position
ICR to push the boundary of ICL's practical value.

*R. Alexander Knipper,Charles S. Knipper,Kaiqi Zhang,Valerie Sims,Clint Bowers,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究对45个大语言模型进行了8种认知偏见的系统性评估，发现LLM在17.8-57.3%的情况下表现出偏见一致性行为，模型规模和提示细节对偏见易感性有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地嵌入现实世界决策过程，需要评估它们是否表现出人类认知偏见，这对确保AI决策的公正性至关重要。

Method: 引入基于多项选择任务的新评估框架，与心理学家合作手工策划220个决策场景数据集，提出从人工编写场景模板生成多样化提示的可扩展方法，分析了280万次LLM响应。

Result: LLM在锚定、可得性、确认、框架、解释、过度归因、前景理论和代表性偏见等8种认知偏见中表现出偏见一致性行为；更大模型规模(>32B参数)在39.5%情况下减少偏见，更详细的提示使大多数偏见减少达14.9%，但过度归因偏见反而增加8.8%。

Conclusion: 大语言模型确实表现出显著的认知偏见，模型规模和提示设计是影响偏见易感性的关键因素，需要进一步研究来减轻这些偏见对AI决策的影响。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in real-world
decision-making processes, it becomes crucial to examine the extent to which
they exhibit cognitive biases. Extensively studied in the field of psychology,
cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human
judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight
well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million
LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this,
we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks,
hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive
biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for
generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis
shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances
across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring,
availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect
theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt
specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger
size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt
detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case
(Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.

*Passant Elchafei,Mayar Osama,Mohamed Rageh,Mervat Abuelkheir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络和transformer的混合方法，通过图结构建模阿拉伯语文档可读性，在文档级别优于单一方法，但GNN在句子级别表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发阿拉伯语文档可读性预测系统，参与BAREC共享任务2025的约束赛道，旨在通过结合图结构和语言模型提升预测性能。

Method: 将文档建模为句子级图，节点包含句子和词元，边捕捉词汇共现和类别关系；使用SAMER词典特征和阿拉伯语transformer嵌入；GNN和transformer作为独立分支训练，通过后期融合结合预测；文档级预测采用最大池化聚合句子输出。

Result: 实验结果表明混合方法在多个可读性指标上优于单独的GNN或transformer分支；融合在文档级别有优势，但纯GNN方法在句子级可读性预测上更精确。

Conclusion: 图神经网络与transformer的融合在文档级可读性预测中表现优越，而GNN单独使用在句子级预测中保持更强性能，显示了不同方法在不同粒度任务中的互补性。

Abstract: We present a graph-based approach enriched with lexicons to predict
document-level readability in Arabic, developed as part of the Constrained
Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Our system models each document as a
sentence-level graph, where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, and edges
capture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class
membership. Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as
well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph
neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two
independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at
inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated
using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results
show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches
across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that
fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach
remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HEART是一个利用情感反馈进行迭代自校正的新框架，通过基于六种基本情感的情感化提示来改进语言模型的推理性能，在复杂推理任务上显著提升准确率，但在无验证器设置下效果不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受心理学研究启发，当前的自反思策略主要关注逻辑或结构改进，未能利用情感反馈的引导潜力。研究表明情绪可以调节认知表现，因此探索情感化提示能否帮助模型摆脱错误的推理路径。

Method: HEART框架使用基于Paul Ekman六种基本情感的简洁情感短语提供反馈，通过系统变化情感语调进行迭代自校正，引导模型探索更有希望的推理路径。

Result: 在OlympiadBench、Humanity's Last Exam和SimpleQA等挑战性推理基准测试中，当有验证器指导时，情感迭代协议能显著提升推理深度和准确率，优于最先进的基线方法。但在无验证器设置下，难以稳定利用这些收益。

Conclusion: 机器推理的下一个前沿不仅在于逻辑精炼，还在于理解和利用模型的'内心'（情感方面）。情感反馈能解锁更深层推理，但无验证器时的稳定性是未来工作的关键挑战。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has shown considerable success in improving the performance
of language models on complex reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical
or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of
affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions
can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that
uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides
feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise,
emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by
Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback
across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths
and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on
challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam,
and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by
an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly
deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy
over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also
identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free
setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a
key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in
machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding
and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在对话中显式使用心理理论(ToM)能显著提升LLM的对话效果和目标达成能力，提出的ToMAgent通过结合ToM和对话前瞻训练，在社交评估基准上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理理论是人类社交智能的关键方面，但现有聊天机器人和基于LLM的社交代理通常不整合这一能力。研究表明显式使用ToM可以提升对话效果。

Method: 提出ToMAgent(ToMA)，通过将心理理论与对话前瞻配对训练，生成对达成对话目标最有用的心理状态。首先验证了简单提示模型在对话轮次间生成心理状态已能带来显著收益。

Result: 在Sotopia交互式社交评估基准上的实验表明，该方法在一系列基线方法中表现更优。ToMA展现出更具战略性、目标导向的推理行为，能够实现长期适应性，同时与对话伙伴保持更好的关系。

Conclusion: 这项研究为构建具有社交智能的LLM代理在整合心理理论方面迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM)-an understanding of the mental states of others-is a key
aspect of human social intelligence, yet, chatbots and LLM-based social agents
do not typically integrate it. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs that
explicitly use ToM get better at dialogue, achieving goals more effectively.
After showing that simply prompting models to generate mental states between
dialogue turns already provides significant benefit, we further introduce
ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent. ToMA is trained by pairing ToM
with dialogue lookahead to produce mental states that are maximally useful for
achieving dialogue goals. Experiments on the Sotopia interactive social
evaluation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over a range
of baselines. Comprehensive analysis shows that ToMA exhibits more strategic,
goal-oriented reasoning behaviors, which enable long-horizon adaptation, while
maintaining better relationships with their partners. Our results suggest a
step forward in integrating ToM for building socially intelligent LLM agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发专门针对文档信息抽取任务的优化模型，证明任务特定的优化可以超越通用系统，同时显著减少计算资源需求。

Method: 采用合成数据生成管道生成280,128个训练样本，使用LoRA进行参数高效微调（仅修改0.53%权重），并通过GRPO强化学习结合语义相似度奖励函数。

Result: 在1000个文档抽取任务基准测试中，平均奖励达到0.573，优于GPT-4.1（0.457）、o3（0.464）和GPT-4.1-2025（0.459）。

Conclusion: 任务特定的优化可以产生超越通用系统的模型，同时大幅减少计算资源需求，为专业领域模型开发提供了有效路径。

Abstract: This paper presents Extract-0, a 7-billion parameter language model
specifically optimized for document information extraction that achieves
performance exceeding models with parameter counts several orders of magnitude
larger. Through a novel combination of synthetic data generation, supervised
fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and reinforcement learning via
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Extract-0 achieves a mean reward of
0.573 on a benchmark of 1,000 diverse document extraction tasks, outperforming
GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459). The training methodology
employs a memory-preserving synthetic data generation pipeline that produces
280,128 training examples from diverse document sources, followed by
parameterefficient fine-tuning that modifies only 0.53% of model weights (40.4M
out of 7.66B parameters). The reinforcement learning phase introduces a novel
semantic similarity-based reward function that handles the inherent ambiguity
in information extraction tasks. This research demonstrates that task-specific
optimization can yield models that surpass general-purpose systems while
requiring substantially fewer computational resource.

TL;DR: GPT-4o在药物相关医疗任务中表现不佳，包括药物剂型匹配、药物相互作用识别和药物订单生成，需要领域特定的训练和评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-4o在推荐适当药物治疗方案中的一致性，因为大型语言模型在医疗诊断中有用，但药物推荐的一致性研究较少。

Method: 使用GPT-4o完成三个实验：药物名称到剂型匹配、药物相互作用识别（使用内部知识和网络搜索）、药物订单句子生成。通过余弦相似度、Levenshtein相似度、ROUGE评分和临床医生手动评估量化准确性。

Result: GPT-4o在药物剂型匹配中表现差，49%的药物正确匹配所有可用剂型；药物相互作用识别中网络搜索比内部知识略好（69.2% vs 54.7%），但无相互作用时网络搜索表现更差；药物订单句子生成中65.8%无错误。

Conclusion: 模型在所有测试中表现总体较差，需要通过临床医生标注的数据集进行领域特定训练，并建立全面的评估框架来基准测试性能。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) can be useful in diagnosing medical
conditions, but few studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending
appropriate medication regimens. The purpose of this evaluation was to test
GPT-4o on three medication benchmarking tests including mapping a drug name to
its correct formulation, identifying drug-drug interactions using both its
internal knowledge and using a web search, and preparing a medication order
sentence after being given the medication name. Methods: Using GTP-4o three
experiments were completed. Accuracy was quantified by computing cosine
similarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and
ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 between each response and its reference string or by manual
evaluation by clinicians. Results: GPT-4o performed poorly on drug-formulation
matching, with frequent omissions of available drug formulations (mean 1.23 per
medication) and hallucinations of formulations that do not exist (mean 1.14 per
medication). Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all
available formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more
formulations (p<0.0001). GPT-4o was also inconsistent at identifying
drug-drug-interactions, although it had better performance with the
search-augmented assessment compared to its internal knowledge (54.7% vs.
69.2%, p=0.013). However, allowing a web-search worsened performance when there
was no drug-drug interaction (median % correct 100% vs. 40%, p<0.001). Finally,
GPT-4o performed moderately with preparing a medication order sentence, with
only 65.8% of medication order sentences containing no medication or
abbreviation errors. Conclusions: Model performance was overall poor for all
tests. This highlights the need for domain-specific training through
clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for
benchmarking performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI能够将内容从一种媒介转换到另一种媒介，这在叙事领域特别有用，视觉插图可以照亮原本以文本表达的故事。

Method: 构建了一个使用LLM作为接口的流水线，通过LLM将原始故事文本转化为适合文生图模型的提示，从而生成场景插图。

Result: 创建了SceneIllustrations数据集，通过人工标注获得插图质量判断，证明了LLM能够有效表达故事文本隐含的场景知识。

Conclusion: LLM在表达故事文本隐含场景知识方面的能力对于生成和评估插图具有重要影响，为跨模态叙事转换提供了新的资源和方法。

Abstract: Generative AI has established the opportunity to readily transform content
from one medium to another. This capability is especially powerful for
storytelling, where visual illustrations can illuminate a story originally
expressed in text. In this paper, we focus on the task of narrative scene
illustration, which involves automatically generating an image depicting a
scene in a story. Motivated by recent progress on text-to-image models, we
consider a pipeline that uses LLMs as an interface for prompting text-to-image
models to generate scene illustrations given raw story text. We apply
variations of this pipeline to a prominent story corpus in order to synthesize
illustrations for scenes in these stories. We conduct a human annotation task
to obtain pairwise quality judgments for these illustrations. The outcome of
this process is the SceneIllustrations dataset, which we release as a new
resource for future work on cross-modal narrative transformation. Through our
analysis of this dataset and experiments modeling illustration quality, we
demonstrate that LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge implicitly
evoked by story text. Moreover, this capability is impactful for generating and
evaluating illustrations.

*Mohammed Sabry,Anya Belz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在等量计算资源下，通过注入前向复制（Induction）、后向复制（Anti）或混合模式的合成数据来训练模型，发现虽然能加速小规模模型中归纳头的出现，但并不能持续提升上下文学习能力。自然文本训练的大模型能自发发展出更广泛、更早出现的归纳头，且这些电路更具功能性必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证在预训练期间显式激活归纳电路是否能改善上下文学习，还是自然文本在等量计算下已经足够。测试目标合成数据是否能加速归纳头的出现并增强ICL能力。

Method: 引入Bi-Induct轻量级课程，在预训练流中注入前向复制（归纳）、后向复制（反归纳）或平衡混合模式。在等量FLOPs下训练0.13B到1B参数模型，评估少样本ICL基准、头级遥测和语言建模困惑度。

Result: Bi-Induct在小规模加速归纳头出现，但不持续提升泛化能力。在标准LM基准上，Bi-Induct与纯自然训练相当；在函数式ICL探针上，1B纯自然模型表现最佳。自然训练的大模型发展出更广泛、更早的归纳头，且这些电路更具功能性必要性。

Conclusion: 单纯诱导激活不足以保证ICL增益，关键在于这些电路必须变得功能必要。结果强调了机制感知的预训练诊断和数据混合策略，应培养具有负载承载能力而非仅仅存在的结构。

Abstract: Does explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improve
in-context learning (ICL), or is natural text sufficient when compute is held
constant (iso-FLOPs)? To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate
induction-head emergence and enhance ICL, we introduce Bi-Induct, a lightweight
curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or a
balanced mix into the pretraining stream. We train models from 0.13B to 1B
parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating (i) few-shot ICL benchmarks, (ii)
head-level telemetry, and (iii) held-out language modeling perplexity. Our
findings challenge the assumption that early induction circuit activation
directly improves ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at
small scales, this does not consistently yield stronger generalization. On
standard LM benchmarks, Bi-Induct matches natural-only training; on
function-style ICL probes, the 1B natural-only performs best. Stress tests
(e.g., label permutation, HITS@1 vs. HITS@3, 1 vs. 10 shots) preserve these
trends. Telemetry shows larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier
induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data fails
to elicit meaningful activation. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data
shrink with scale, suggesting larger models can absorb non-natural patterns
with minimal cost. Crucially, ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades
ICL more than random ablations, especially for natural-only models, indicating
more centralized, load-bearing circuits. Bi-Induct variants exhibit more
redundant induction activity, implying different circuit utilization. Overall,
inducing activation is not sufficient: ICL gains depend on these circuits
becoming functionally necessary. These results underscore mechanism-aware
pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing, not merely
present, structure.

TL;DR: 自监督语音模型在识别英语名词和动词屈折变化时，其表征展现出全局线性几何结构，能够连接词干与屈折形式。这种几何结构不直接对应语音学或形态学单元，而是追踪英语词汇中词对之间的分布关系。


<details>

Motivation: 理解自监督语音模型在嘈杂自然环境中识别口语单词时使用的语言表征类型，特别是对语音学和形态学现象的表征方式。

Method: 研究针对单词识别优化的S3M变体模型，分析它们如何表征英语名词和动词常见屈折变化的语音学和形态学现象。

Result: 模型表征展现出全局线性几何结构，能够连接英语名词和动词与其规则屈折形式，但这种结构不直接对应语音学或形态学单元，而是追踪词汇间的分布关系。

Conclusion: 这些发现提出了支持人类口语单词识别的候选表征策略，挑战了语音学和形态学需要独立语言表征的传统假设。

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models can be trained to efficiently recognize spoken
words in naturalistic, noisy environments. However, we do not understand the
types of linguistic representations these models use to accomplish this task.
To address this question, we study how S3M variants optimized for word
recognition represent phonological and morphological phenomena in frequent
English noun and verb inflections. We find that their representations exhibit a
global linear geometry which can be used to link English nouns and verbs to
their regular inflected forms.
  This geometric structure does not directly track phonological or
morphological units. Instead, it tracks the regular distributional
relationships linking many word pairs in the English lexicon -- often, but not
always, due to morphological inflection. These findings point to candidate
representational strategies that may support human spoken word recognition,
challenging the presumed necessity of distinct linguistic representations of
phonology and morphology.

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统分析了表格表示形式对问答性能的影响，发现SQL方法在结构化数据上表现最佳但难以处理半结构化数据，LLM具有灵活性但精度较低，混合方法在噪声模式下表现平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格问答基准测试受限于固定数据格式，未能系统研究表格表示形式本身如何影响模型性能。真实场景中需要同时处理结构化数据库和包含文本字段的半结构化表格。

Method: 使用语言化管道生成配对的结枃化和半结构化表格，保持内容不变仅改变结构。引入诊断基准，按表格大小、连接需求、查询复杂度和模式质量进行划分。

Result: 实验显示一致的权衡：SQL方法在结构化输入上准确率高但在半结构化数据上性能下降，LLM具有灵活性但精度降低，混合方法在噪声模式下表现最佳。这些效应随表格增大和查询复杂化而加剧。

Conclusion: 没有任何单一方法在所有条件下都表现优异，表格表示形式在塑造问答性能中起核心作用。研究结果为模型选择和设计提供了可行见解，为适应多样化真实世界数据格式的更强健混合方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (Table QA) in real-world settings must operate over
both structured databases and semi-structured tables containing textual fields.
However, existing benchmarks are tied to fixed data formats and have not
systematically examined how representation itself affects model performance. We
present the first controlled study that isolates the role of table
representation by holding content constant while varying structure. Using a
verbalization pipeline, we generate paired structured and semi-structured
tables, enabling direct comparisons across modeling paradigms. To support
detailed analysis, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark with splits along table
size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality. Our experiments
reveal consistent trade-offs: SQL-based methods achieve high accuracy on
structured inputs but degrade on semi-structured data, LLMs exhibit flexibility
but reduced precision, and hybrid approaches strike a balance, particularly
under noisy schemas. These effects intensify with larger tables and more
complex queries. Ultimately, no single method excels across all conditions, and
we highlight the central role of representation in shaping Table QA
performance. Our findings provide actionable insights for model selection and
design, paving the way for more robust hybrid approaches suited for diverse
real-world data formats.

Result: AdamRAG显著提升开源模型性能，对闭源模型也有适度改善，在低阶推理任务上提升最大。流行度强烈影响准确性，人脸图像的多模态输入改善较小且不稳定。

Conclusion: ADAM建立了首个基于认知、文化和多模态的传记评估基准和框架，推动了多语言、准确且抗幻觉的MLLMs发展。

Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating
and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical
reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet
underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a
multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across
geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively
structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels
in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly
for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that
AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits
closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity
strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers
smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the
first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally
grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual,
accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with
large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for
comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis
was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of
topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing
human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human
corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown
Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in
Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic,
Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and
are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are
tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The
subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on
average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on
average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely
available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are
under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence) and are also accessible through the search
interface of the Czech National Corpus.

TL;DR: 提出了ReMemR1记忆增强代理，通过回调增强记忆机制和强化学习多级奖励，解决了长上下文问答中信息分散、记忆覆盖和信息丢失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在长上下文问答中面临关键证据分散在数百万token中的挑战，现有的'边读边记'方法存在不可逆的前向处理、信息覆盖丢失和稀疏强化学习信号等问题。

Method: ReMemR1采用回调增强记忆机制，允许从整个记忆历史中选择性检索，支持非线性推理和早期证据重访；同时提出RLMLR强化学习方法，结合最终答案奖励和密集的步骤级信号来指导有效记忆使用。

Result: 在长文档问答实验中，相比现有基于记忆的方法取得了显著提升，验证了ReMemR1作为长上下文推理代理的有效解决方案。

Conclusion: ReMemR1通过缓解信息退化、改进监督和支持多跳记忆利用，为长上下文推理代理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering,
where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens.
Existing works equip large language models with a memory corpus that is
dynamically updated during a single-pass document scan, also known as the
"memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it
suffers from irreversible forward-only processing, information loss through
overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these
challenges, we present ReMemR1, a memory-augmented agent with callback-enhanced
memory that allows selective retrieval from the entire memory history and
allows non-linear reasoning and revisiting of early evidence. To further
strengthen training, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards
(RLMLR), which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals
that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate
information degradation, improve supervision, and support multi-hop memory
utilizing. Experiments on long-document QA show significant gains over existing
memory-based approaches, which validates ReMemR1 as an effective solution for
long-context reasoning agents.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLMs在MADS中的谄媚行为，提出了首个针对多智能体辩论系统的谄媚性操作框架，揭示了谄媚性是导致辩论失败的核心模式，并提出了设计原则来平衡生产性分歧与合作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在MADS中表现出过度顺从的谄媚行为，这会导致辩论过早达成共识，削弱多智能体辩论的优势。现有研究主要关注用户-LLM谄媚性，而智能体间谄媚性在辩论中的影响尚不明确。

Method: 提出了首个操作框架：(1)为MADS设定正式定义谄媚性；(2)开发新指标评估智能体谄媚水平及其对信息交换的影响；(3)系统研究不同角色(辩论者和裁判)谄媚性水平在分散和集中辩论框架中对结果的影响。

Result: 发现谄媚性是核心失败模式：在达到正确结论前放大分歧崩溃；导致比单智能体基线更低的准确性；源于不同的辩论者驱动和裁判驱动失败模式。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果提出了MADS的可操作设计原则，有效平衡智能体交互中的生产性分歧与合作。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often display sycophancy, a tendency toward
excessive agreeability. This behavior poses significant challenges for
multi-agent debating systems (MADS) that rely on productive disagreement to
refine arguments and foster innovative thinking. LLMs' inherent sycophancy can
collapse debates into premature consensus, potentially undermining the benefits
of multi-agent debate. While prior studies focus on user--LLM sycophancy, the
impact of inter-agent sycophancy in debate remains poorly understood. To
address this gap, we introduce the first operational framework that (1)
proposes a formal definition of sycophancy specific to MADS settings, (2)
develops new metrics to evaluate the agent sycophancy level and its impact on
information exchange in MADS, and (3) systematically investigates how varying
levels of sycophancy across agent roles (debaters and judges) affects outcomes
in both decentralized and centralized debate frameworks. Our findings reveal
that sycophancy is a core failure mode that amplifies disagreement collapse
before reaching a correct conclusion in multi-agent debates, yields lower
accuracy than single-agent baselines, and arises from distinct debater-driven
and judge-driven failure modes. Building on these findings, we propose
actionable design principles for MADS, effectively balancing productive
disagreement with cooperation in agent interactions.

Motivation: 监督数据获取成本上升推动LLM自改进需求，但多数投票等无监督信号在不可验证任务中受限，而自评估方法存在计算开销大和过度自信问题。

Method: 提出语义投票机制，将硬匹配原则放松为软匹配，利用轻量级句子嵌入模型量化语义相似度，避免自评估的计算负担和内在偏差。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法在计算效率上取得显著提升，在多种模型架构和任务中整体性能优于自评估方法。

Conclusion: 语义投票为不可验证任务提供了一种轻量级且有效的自改进方案，克服了自评估方法的高计算成本和内在偏差限制。

Abstract: The rising cost of acquiring supervised data has driven significant interest
in self-improvement for large language models (LLMs). Straightforward
unsupervised signals like majority voting have proven effective in generating
pseudo-labels for verifiable tasks, while their applicability to unverifiable
tasks (e.g., translation) is limited by the open-ended character of responses.
As a result, self-evaluation mechanisms (e.g., self-judging and entropy
minimization) are predominantly used to derive pseudo-labels. However,
self-evaluation relying on LLMs typically incurs high computational overhead
and introduces overconfidence issues due to intrinsic biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable
tasks, designed for lightweight yet effective self-improvement. Inspired by
majority voting commonly employed in verifiable tasks, we propose semantic
voting as a novel mechanism that relaxes the principle of hard matching (i.e.,
exact matching) toward soft matching (i.e., semantic similarity). Soft matching
is achieved by leveraging a lightweight sentence embedding model to quantify
semantic similarity, thereby mitigating excessive computational burden and
intrinsic bias-associated limitations of self-evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial gains in
computational efficiency and overall better performance than self-evaluation
methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了EviPath方法，通过证据锚定的推理路径合成来训练RAG代理，解决了现有方法缺乏过程级监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成代理开发缺乏过程级监督来指导任务分解、检索器调用和逐步决策能力，现有数据合成方法只能产生思维链推理而无法建模环境交互。

Method: EviPath包含三个组件：溯因子任务规划（分解问题并基于依赖关系规划最优路径）、忠实子问题回答（使用支持证据构建代理环境生成推理）、对话微调（将完整交互轨迹格式化为对话格式进行监督微调）。

Result: 在广泛使用的问答基准测试中，使用EviPath合成数据训练的8B参数模型显著优于最先进基线，在开放域问答中实现了14.7%的绝对EM增益。

Conclusion: EviPath使LLM能够直接从合成数据中学习复杂推理和工具使用能力，为RAG代理开发提供了有效的训练范式。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of
process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task
decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While
reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse
rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought
rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we
propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG
agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which
decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal
solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful
Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy
environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question;
and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete
agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for
Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and
tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on
widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model
trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of
14.7% in open-domain question answering.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于置信集的几何框架来量化和分解神经文本生成中的不确定性，通过分析人类创意变异来校准模型输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型在创意任务中的不确定性是一个基本挑战，特别是在存在多个有效输出的情况下。

Method: 使用置信集（概率分布的凸包）分析框架，在WritingPrompts数据集上评估4个语言模型和5种解码策略，生成100,000个故事。

Result: 发现模型在捕捉人类创意变异方面存在显著差距，最佳模型-人类校准度仅为0.434；解码策略贡献了39.4%-72.0%的总认知不确定性。

Conclusion: 几何框架为改进生成系统以实现人机创意对齐提供了可行见解，模型规模与校准质量相关性较弱，基础模型与指令调优模型在校准质量上无显著差异。

Abstract: Understanding uncertainty in large language models remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly in creative tasks where multiple valid outputs exist.
We present a geometric framework using credal sets - convex hulls of
probability distributions - to quantify and decompose uncertainty in neural
text generation, calibrated against human creative variation. Analyzing 500
creative writing prompts from the WritingPrompts dataset with 10 unique human
continuations each, we evaluate four language models across five decoding
strategies, generating 100,000 stories. Our credal set analysis reveals
substantial gaps in capturing human creative variation, with the best
model-human calibration reaching only 0.434 (Gemma-2B with temperature 0.7). We
decompose total uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, finding
that the choice of decoding strategy contributes 39.4% to 72.0% of total
epistemic uncertainty. Model scale shows weak correlation with calibration
quality and no significant difference exists between base and instruction-tuned
models in calibration quality. Our geometric framework provides actionable
insights for improving generation systems for human-AI creative alignment. We
release our complete experimental framework.

TL;DR: 提出d²Cache框架，通过两阶段细粒度选择策略自适应更新KV状态，加速扩散式大语言模型推理，同时提高生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型因依赖双向注意力机制，无法直接受益于标准KV缓存，导致推理效率低下。

Method: 采用训练自由的两阶段细粒度选择策略，识别关键token并自适应更新其KV状态，同时缓存其余token的KV状态以供重用。

Result: 在LLaDA和Dream模型上的实验表明，d²Cache不仅显著加速推理，还一致提升生成质量。

Conclusion: d²Cache是有效的训练自由近似KV缓存框架，能同时提升扩散式大语言模型的推理效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), despite their promising
performance, still suffer from inferior inference efficiency. This is because
dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention and cannot directly benefit from the
standard key-value (KV) cache as autoregressive models (ARMs) do. To tackle
this issue, we introduce \textit{Dual aDaptive Cache} (d$^2$Cache), which is a
training-free approximate KV cache framework for accelerating dLLM inference.
d$^2$Cache features a two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to identify
tokens and adaptively update their KV states at each decoding step, while
caching the KV states of the remaining tokens for reuse. Furthermore,
d$^2$Cache naturally offers a more reliable decoding alternative, which can
enable quasi left-to-right generation and mitigate premature overconfidence in
tokens at the end of the sequence. Extensive experimental results on two
representative dLLMs (\ie, LLaDA and Dream) demonstrate that d$^2$Cache not
only achieves substantial inference speedups, but also yields consistent
improvements in generation quality. The code is available at
https://github.com/Kamichanw/d2Cache.

<details>

Motivation: LLMs在少样本设置下使用SMILES表示生成有效分子存在困难，而SELFIES表示虽然能保证有效性但LLMs表现更差，需要一种能确保分子有效性同时保持性能的方法。

Method: 开发了SmiSelf跨化学语言框架，利用语法规则将无效SMILES转换为SELFIES，利用SELFIES的机制来校正无效SMILES。

Result: SmiSelf确保100%分子有效性，同时保持分子特征，在其他指标上维持甚至提升性能，与所有基于SMILES的生成模型兼容。

Conclusion: SmiSelf扩展了LLMs在生物医学中的实际应用，为分子生成提供了一种可靠的有效性保证方法。

Abstract: Molecule generation is key to drug discovery and materials science, enabling
the design of novel compounds with specific properties. Large language models
(LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of tasks from just a few examples.
However, generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is
challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings. In this work, we explore how LLMs
can generate 100% valid molecules. We evaluate whether LLMs can use SELFIES, a
representation where every string corresponds to a valid molecule, for valid
molecule generation but find that LLMs perform worse with SELFIES than with
SMILES. We then examine LLMs' ability to correct invalid SMILES and find their
capacity limited. Finally, we introduce SmiSelf, a cross-chemical language
framework for invalid SMILES correction. SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to
SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct the
invalid SMILES. Experiments show that SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while
preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing
performance on other metrics. SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications
in biomedicine and is compatible with all SMILES-based generative models. Code

Simulation TL;DR: A non-collaborative user simulation method for tool agent.
Abstract: Tool agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogues to
accomplish various tasks. Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods
to develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user
simulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors,
which fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the
real world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture
that simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting
unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing
impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can
simulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably
delivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our
experiments on MultiWOZ and $\tau$-bench reveal significant performance
degradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative
users. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each
non-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue
breakdowns. Ultimately, we contribute an easily extensible user simulation
framework to help the research community develop tool agents and preemptively
diagnose them under challenging real-world conditions within their own
services.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在通用推理方面表现出色，但在个性化推理方面存在不足，无法有效分析用户历史、推断独特偏好并生成定制化响应。

Method: 开发数据驱动管道自动生成带语义标签的推理链，采用监督微调建立基础推理模式，然后进行多阶段强化学习，使用包含标签约束和个性化奖励模型的复合奖励信号。

Conclusion: 结构化、可解释的推理是解锁LLM真正个性化能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with impressive
general reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with personalization
reasoning - the crucial ability to analyze user history, infer unique
preferences, and generate tailored responses. To address this limitation, we
introduce TagPR, a novel training framework that significantly enhances an
LLM's intrinsic capacity for personalization reasoning through a tagging the
thought approach. Our method first develops a data-driven pipeline to
automatically generate and semantically label reasoning chains, creating a
structured dataset that fosters interpretable reasoning. We then propose a
synergistic training strategy that begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on
this tagged data to establish foundational reasoning patterns, followed by a
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) process. This RL phase is guided by a
unique composite reward signal, which integrates tag-based constraints and a
novel Personalization Reward Model with User Embeddings (PRMU) to achieve
fine-grained alignment with user-specific logic. Extensive experiments on the
public LaMP benchmark and a self-constructed dataset demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results, delivering an average improvement
of 32.65% over the base model across all tasks. Our work validates that
structured, interpretable reasoning is a highly effective pathway to unlocking
genuine personalization capabilities in LLMs.

TL;DR: TReASURe是一种基于树搜索的测试时对齐方法，通过UnmaskBranch分支策略和ResubstituteScore剪枝规则，解决了掩码扩散语言模型中树搜索的两个关键挑战：并行解掩导致高度相关分支和奖励评估的高方差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将树搜索应用于掩码扩散语言模型时面临两个主要挑战：(i) 并行解掩产生高度相关的分支，限制了探索；(ii) 通过采样完成进行奖励评估会产生高方差估计，导致剪枝不稳定。

Method: 提出TReASURe方法，包含：(i) UnmaskBranch分支策略，基于首次命中解掩，通过每个父节点单次模型调用实现令牌内容和揭示顺序的多样化；(ii) ResubstituteScore剪枝规则，使用确定性重替换通过低方差代理完成来评分部分掩码序列。

Result: 在困惑度、语言可接受性以及情感和毒性控制方面达到最先进结果，在匹配计算预算下优于先前方法，在低NFE（函数评估次数）情况下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: TReASURe通过改进的分支策略和剪枝规则有效解决了掩码扩散语言模型中树搜索的挑战，在理论和实证上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Tree search has recently emerged as a powerful framework for aligning
generative models with task-specific rewards at test time. Applying tree search
to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges:
(i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration,
and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance
estimates, making pruning unstable. We propose TReASURe, a tree-search
test-time alignment method that addresses these issues. It introduces (i)
UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that
diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per
parent node, and (ii) ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic
resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy
completions. Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs
(number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the
true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove
improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves
state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control
of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute
budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多轮交互中性能下降，因为它们通常在静态单轮数据上训练，无法适应实时用户反馈。

Method: 提出T2PAM范式，利用用户反馈作为奖励信号估计最优策略，然后更新少量参数；引入ROSA算法实现单步高效策略更新。

Result: 理论分析证明ROSA策略会随交互次数增加收敛到用户偏好；在挑战性基准测试中，ROSA在任务效果和效率方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: T2PAM和ROSA为LLMs在多轮交互中的在线适应提供了有效解决方案，实现了高效的自校正能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employ multi-turn interaction as a fundamental
paradigm for completing complex tasks. However, their performance often
degrades in extended interactions, as they are typically trained on static,
single-turn data, which hinders their ability to adapt to real-time user
feedback. To address this limitation, we first propose a new paradigm:
Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Multi-Turn Interactions (T2PAM), which utilizes
user feedback from the ongoing interaction as a reward signal to estimate a
latent optimal policy aligned with user preferences, then updates a small
subset of parameters to steer the model toward this policy, ultimately enabling
efficient in-conversation self-correction. We then introduce Optimum-Referenced
One-Step Adaptation (ROSA), a lightweight algorithm that operationalizes T2PAM.
ROSA guides the model parameters toward a theoretical optimal policy in a
single, efficient update step, avoiding costly iterative gradient-based
optimization and minimizing computational overhead. We provide a rigorous
theoretical analysis guaranteeing that the policy of ROSA converges to the
preference of user as the number of interactions increases. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmark demonstrate that ROSA achieves significant
improvements in both task effectiveness and efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受链式思维(CoT)在推理时通过增加生成步骤提升性能的启发，探索是否能在预训练阶段通过增加计算步骤来改善每个token的生成质量。

Method: 预训练语言模型先生成中间潜在思维（当前位置的最后一个隐藏状态），然后使用该潜在表示作为输入来预测实际的下一个token，允许模型在无约束连续空间中优化预测。

Result: 在相同推理成本下，生成一个额外潜在思维的1.4B模型显著优于在相同数据上训练的2.8B标准模型，在语言建模和各种下游任务上都表现更好。增加潜在思维数量能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 在预训练阶段引入潜在思维生成步骤是提升语言模型性能的有效方法，在保持推理成本不变的情况下显著优于参数更多的标准模型。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which enhances performance
by scaling generation steps at test-time, inspires us to ask: can we leverage a
similar scaling of computational steps during pretraining to improve the
generation of each individual token? To address this, we propose a novel
pre-training methodology: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts. Our
approach pretrains a language model (LM) to first generate an intermediate
latent thought-the last hidden state of the current position-which is then used
as input to predict the actual subsequent token. This additional computational
step enables the LM to refine its prediction within unconstrained continuous
space. Our experiments demonstrate that, at an identical inference cost, a LM
that generates one additional latent thought per token outperforms a standard
model with double the parameters. For instance, ours-1.4B (Pythia Arch),
pretrained on 300B tokens from the Pile, significantly surpasses the vanilla
Pythia-2.8B trained on the same data on both language modeling and a range of
general downstream tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of latent thoughts
generated before each actual token-forming a chain analogous to
CoT-consistently improves the model's performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个三阶段框架来解决多智能体系统中的指令冲突问题：诊断（CRAS评分）、定位（注意力漂移分析）和对齐（SAIL手术式微调），显著提高了指令层级遵从性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统在复杂任务中表现出色，但存在系统性故障模式：在指令冲突（系统-用户、对等体之间）下的层级遵从问题，且现有宏观指标无法有效识别这些微观违规行为。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 诊断 - 使用CRAS评分指标分解角色遵从性；2) 定位 - 注意力漂移分析识别关键层；3) 对齐 - SAIL手术式微调，仅在定位的关键层安装LoRA并优化token加权的偏好目标。

Result: 在标准基准和多智能体框架上，该方法显著提高了指令层级遵从性（如AutoGen在MedQA上提升5.60%），无需全模型微调。

Conclusion: 提出的手术式对齐方法能有效解决多智能体系统中的指令冲突问题，通过针对性的层间干预实现高效优化。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have rapidly
advanced collaborative reasoning, tool use, and role-specialized coordination
in complex tasks. However, reliability-critical deployment remains hindered by
a systemic failure mode: hierarchical compliance under instruction conflicts
(system-user, peer-peer), where agents misprioritize system-level rules in the
presence of competing demands. Moreover, widely used macro-level metrics (e.g.,
pass@k) obscure these micro-level violations and offer little actionable
guidance for remedy. In this work, we present a full-stack, three-stage
framework: (1) Diagnose - Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS), a
query-wise, context-aware scoring metric that decomposes role adherence into
four measurable dimensions; (2) Localize - attention drift analysis revealing
that instruction conflicts are resolved by attention heads that are largely
concentrated in middle layers; (3) Align - Surgical Alignment of Instruction
Layers (SAIL), which installs LoRA only on the localized focal layers and
optimizes a token-weighted DPO-style preference objective that credits tokens
by their focal attentional contribution. Across standard benchmarks and MAS
frameworks, our surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance
(e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without full-model finetuning.

*Nan Wang,Jiaxuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过结合EEG和眼动追踪数据，发现在自然阅读中短语结构构建先于句法类别检测，支持预测性的"树状支架"理解模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有句法处理时间证据主要来自违反范式，这种方法混淆了句法类别检测和短语结构构建两个可分离的过程，并隐含假设短语结构构建在类别检测之后。

Method: 使用ZuCo语料库中共同记录的EEG和眼动追踪数据，分析注视转换、贝叶斯网络建模和注视相关电位。

Result: 读者优先在句法核心词之间移动；结构深度是偏离线性阅读的最强驱动因素；句法惊奇度在词出现前(-184到-10ms)和早期整合阶段(48到300ms)影响神经活动。

Conclusion: 短语结构构建可以早于句法类别检测，并主导词汇影响，支持预测性的"树状支架"理解模型。

Abstract: A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence
processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which
conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase
structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows
category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking
data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their
temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze
transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads,
suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize
scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was
the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical
familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated
that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to
-10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend
current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure
construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences,
supporting a predictive "tree-scaffolding" account of comprehension.

Motivation: 重新审视推理大语言模型在少样本思维链提示下表现不佳的悖论，探究其背后的机制并寻找解决方案。

Method: 提出I2S方法，通过将演示转化为明确的、可重用的见解，并生成目标特定的推理轨迹；I2S+版本还包含自我精炼机制以确保推理的连贯性和正确性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，I2S和I2S+始终优于直接回答和测试时扩展基线方法，GPT-4.1在AIME'25上提升14.0%，o1-mini在AIME和GPQA上分别提升2.7%和1.7%。

Conclusion: 通过洞察-精炼-解决框架，可以有效地利用上下文演示来提升推理大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent reasoning LLMs (RLMs), especially those trained with verifier-based
reinforcement learning, often perform worse with few-shot CoT than with direct
answering. We revisit this paradox using high-quality reasoning traces from
DeepSeek-R1 as demonstrations and find that adding more exemplars consistently
degrades accuracy, even when demonstrations are optimal. A detailed analysis
reveals two mechanisms behind this decline: (i) semantic misguidance, where
high textual similarity leads the model to treat the target as the same as the
exemplar and to copy intermediate steps verbatim; and (ii) strategy transfer
failure, where the model struggles to extract useful reasoning strategies and
apply them to target questions. Guided by these, we introduce Insight-to-Solve
(I2S), a sequential test-time procedure that turns demonstrations into
explicit, reusable insights and derives a target-specific reasoning trace;
optionally, the reasoning is self-refined for coherence and correctness (I2S+).
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that I2S and I2S+ consistently
outperform both direct answering and test-time scaling baselines across open-
and closed-source models. Even for GPT models, our method helps: on AIME'25,
GPT-4.1 rises by +14.0%, and o1-mini improves by +2.7% on AIME and +1.7% on
GPQA, indicating that in-context demonstrations can be harnessed effectively
via insight-refine-solve framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究K-pop歌曲中语码转换和英语歌词使用对全球榜单成功的语言学策略，探讨全球化市场压力如何影响K-pop歌词的语言选择。

Method: 收集2017-2025年登上Billboard Hot 100和Global 200榜单的K-pop歌曲数据集，分析英语和韩语歌词比例、语码转换频率等特征，并进行统计测试和分类任务。

Result: 英语在全球热门K-pop歌曲中占主导地位，男女表演者都表现出高程度的语码转换和英语使用；统计测试显示性别差异不显著，但女性独唱歌手更倾向使用英语；分类任务预测表演者性别的宏F1分数达0.76。

Conclusion: K-pop歌词的语言选择受到全球市场压力的影响，英语使用对美国榜单成功更为关键，同时揭示了反映表演者身份和榜单背景的风格模式。

Abstract: Code switching, particularly between Korean and English, has become a
defining feature of modern K-pop, reflecting both aesthetic choices and global
market strategies. This paper is a primary investigation into the linguistic
strategies employed in K-pop songs that achieve global chart success, with a
focus on the role of code-switching and English lyric usage. A dataset of K-pop
songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts from 2017 to
2025, spanning 14 groups and 8 solo artists, was compiled. Using this dataset,
the proportion of English and Korean lyrics, the frequency of code-switching,
and other stylistic features were analysed. It was found that English dominates
the linguistic landscape of globally charting K-pop songs, with both male and
female performers exhibiting high degrees of code-switching and English usage.
Statistical tests indicated no significant gender-based differences, although
female solo artists tend to favour English more consistently. A classification
task was also performed to predict performer gender from lyrics, achieving
macro F1 scores up to 0.76 using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted
features. Finally, differences between songs charting on the Hot 100 versus the
Global 200 were examined, suggesting that, while there is no significant gender
difference in English, higher English usage may be more critical for success in
the US-focused Hot 100. The findings highlight how linguistic choices in K-pop
lyrics are shaped by global market pressures and reveal stylistic patterns that
reflect performer identity and chart context.

*Stefan Arnold,René Gröbner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析Gemma-2语言模型，揭示了介词短语补语功能角色（工具性修饰语vs属性性修饰语）的生成机制，并通过调控单个注意力头来改变补语的功能分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在生成介词短语时需要决定补语是作为工具性修饰语（副词性修饰动词）还是属性性修饰语（形容词性修饰名词），但这一决策的内部机制尚不清楚。

Method: 构建包含with引导介词短语的提示集，这些短语的上下文同样支持工具性或属性性补语；通过将激活投影到词汇空间来识别偏好工具性补语的注意力头；通过缩放单个注意力头的值向量来调控补语功能分布。

Result: 模型对工具性补语有强烈偏好（3:4比例）；通过调控单个注意力头，可以将工具性补语比例降至33%，同时将属性性补语提升至36%。

Conclusion: 语言模型中存在特定的注意力头负责介词短语补语的功能角色决策，通过干预这些注意力头可以控制补语的功能分布，为理解模型内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language Models, when generating prepositional phrases, must often decide for
whether their complements functions as an instrumental adjunct (describing the
verb adverbially) or an attributive modifier (enriching the noun adjectivally),
yet the internal mechanisms that resolve this split decision remain poorly
understood. In this study, we conduct a targeted investigation into Gemma-2 to
uncover and control the generation of prepositional complements. We assemble a
prompt suite containing with-headed prepositional phrases whose contexts
equally accommodate either an instrumental or attributive continuation,
revealing a strong preference for an instrumental reading at a ratio of 3:4. To
pinpoint individual attention heads that favor instrumental over attributive
complements, we project activations into the vocabulary space. By scaling the
value vector of a single attention head, we can shift the distribution of
functional roles of complements, attenuating instruments to 33% while elevating
attributes to 36%.

TL;DR: PARL-MT框架通过引入进度感知机制，显著提升了LLM在多轮函数调用任务中的表现，解决了现有方法在长期任务规划和上下文冗余方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用如旅行规划或多阶段数据分析通常涉及多轮对话，现有方法要么将多轮训练简化为孤立单轮样本（忽略任务级规划），要么使用端到端强化学习（存在冗余问题且缺乏明确的进度感知集成）。

Method: 提出PARL-MT框架，包含：(1)进度感知生成(PAG)管道，自动构建耦合对话摘要与未来任务规划的数据集；(2)进度感知引导强化学习(PAG-RL)算法，将进度感知集成到RL训练中，减少上下文冗余并改善局部动作与全局任务完成的对齐。

Result: 在两个公共基准测试上的实证结果表明，PARL-MT显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 进度感知在实现稳健高效的多轮函数调用方面具有显著效果，PARL-MT框架为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn
function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or
multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In
these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step
but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past
interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task
execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to
isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks
explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness
into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a
Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs
datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a
Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which
integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy
and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT
significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of
progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function
calling.

Abstract: This study aims to test and evaluate the capabilities and characteristics of
current mainstream Visual Language Models (VLMs) in generating critiques for
traditional Chinese painting. To achieve this, we first developed a
quantitative framework for Chinese painting critique. This framework was
constructed by extracting multi-dimensional evaluative features covering
evaluative stance, feature focus, and commentary quality from human expert
critiques using a zero-shot classification model. Based on these features,
several representative critic personas were defined and quantified. This
framework was then employed to evaluate selected VLMs such as Llama, Qwen, or
Gemini. The experimental design involved persona-guided prompting to assess the
VLM's ability to generate critiques from diverse perspectives. Our findings
reveal the current performance levels, strengths, and areas for improvement of
VLMs in the domain of art critique, offering insights into their potential and
limitations in complex semantic understanding and content generation tasks. The

Motivation: 维基百科作为最大的开放知识库，被广泛用于训练大语言模型和检索增强生成系统，确保其准确性至关重要。但维基百科的不一致性程度及其改进方法尚不清楚。

Method: 提出CLAIRE系统，结合LLM推理与检索技术，识别潜在不一致声明并提供上下文证据供人工审核。通过用户研究和随机抽样分析维基百科的不一致性。

Result: 研究发现至少3.3%的英文维基百科事实存在矛盾，这些不一致性传播到7.3%的FEVEROUS和4.0%的AmbigQA示例中。CLAIRE使编辑者在相同时间内多识别64.7%的不一致性。

Conclusion: 矛盾是维基百科中可测量的组成部分，基于LLM的系统如CLAIRE能够为编辑者提供实用工具，帮助大规模改进知识一致性。

Abstract: Wikipedia is the largest open knowledge corpus, widely used worldwide and
serving as a key resource for training large language models (LLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Ensuring its accuracy is
therefore critical. But how accurate is Wikipedia, and how can we improve it?
  We focus on inconsistencies, a specific type of factual inaccuracy, and
introduce the task of corpus-level inconsistency detection. We present CLAIRE,
an agentic system that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval to surface
potentially inconsistent claims along with contextual evidence for human
review. In a user study with experienced Wikipedia editors, 87.5% reported
higher confidence when using CLAIRE, and participants identified 64.7% more
inconsistencies in the same amount of time.
  Combining CLAIRE with human annotation, we contribute WIKICOLLIDE, the first
benchmark of real Wikipedia inconsistencies. Using random sampling with
CLAIRE-assisted analysis, we find that at least 3.3% of English Wikipedia facts
contradict another fact, with inconsistencies propagating into 7.3% of FEVEROUS
and 4.0% of AmbigQA examples. Benchmarking strong baselines on this dataset
reveals substantial headroom: the best fully automated system achieves an AUROC
of only 75.1%.
  Our results show that contradictions are a measurable component of Wikipedia
and that LLM-based systems like CLAIRE can provide a practical tool to help
editors improve knowledge consistency at scale.

Conclusion: 该框架支持批量评估、可视化和校准导出，为金融对话挖掘提供了可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Financial dialogue transcripts pose a unique challenge for sentence-level
information extraction due to their informal structure, domain-specific
vocabulary, and variable intent density. We introduce Fin-ExBERT, a lightweight
and modular framework for extracting user intent-relevant sentences from
annotated financial service calls. Our approach builds on a domain-adapted BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) backbone enhanced
with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters, enabling efficient fine-tuning using
limited labeled data. We propose a two-stage training strategy with progressive
unfreezing: initially training a classifier head while freezing the backbone,
followed by gradual fine-tuning of the entire model with differential learning
rates. To ensure robust extraction under uncertainty, we adopt a dynamic
thresholding strategy based on probability curvature (elbow detection),
avoiding fixed cutoff heuristics. Empirical results show strong precision and
F1 performance on real-world transcripts, with interpretable output suitable
for downstream auditing and question-answering workflows. The full framework
supports batched evaluation, visualization, and calibrated export, offering a
deployable solution for financial dialogue mining.

TL;DR: 提出A2D方法，通过token级对齐使扩散大语言模型在检测到有害内容时发出[EOS]拒绝信号，防御任意解码顺序和任意步骤预填充攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型的任意顺序生成特性扩大了攻击面，有害内容可能出现在任意位置，模板预填充攻击如DIJA可绕过响应级拒绝机制。

Method: 在随机掩码下进行token级安全对齐，使模型在有害内容出现时发出[EOS]拒绝信号，支持实时监控和自动终止。

Result: 在安全基准测试中，A2D持续阻止有害输出生成，将DIJA成功率从80%以上降至接近零（LLaDA-8B-Instruct为1.3%，Dream-v0-Instruct-7B为0.0%），阈值化[EOS]概率可实现早期拒绝，安全终止速度提升达19.3倍。

Conclusion: A2D方法有效防御任意顺序和任意步骤攻击，提供实时监控能力，显著提升扩散大语言模型的安全性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) enable any-order generation, but this
flexibility enlarges the attack surface: harmful spans may appear at arbitrary
positions, and template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA bypass
response-level refusals. We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a
token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal
whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level
under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order
and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables
real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if
unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents
the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to
near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and
thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x
faster safe termination.

Motivation: 政策合规评估需要专家级别的逐步推理过程，但获取这种黄金标准的推理过程成本高昂。

Method: 引入Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT)，这是一种专门的生成推理链，作为推理桥梁来改进LLM的政策合规评估能力。

Result: 在推理时和训练时使用PRT显著提升了开源和商业模型的性能，在HIPAA和GDPR政策上达到了新的最优水平。PRT还提高了LLM准确引用政策条款的能力。

Conclusion: PRT通过高利用率的原始思维链影响合规决策，有效提升了政策合规评估的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Policy compliance assessment is a fundamental task of evaluating whether an
input case strictly complies with a set of human-defined rules, more generally
known as policies. In practice, human experts follow a systematic, step-by-step
process to identify violations with respect to specific stipulations outlined
in the policy. However, such documentation of gold-standard, expert-level
reasoning processes is costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Policy
Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that
serve as a reasoning bridge to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment
capabilities. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for
both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the
performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new
state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Beyond accuracy gains, we also
highlight how PRTs can improve an LLM's ability to accurately cite policy
clauses, as well as influence compliance decisions through their high
utilization from the raw chains of thought.

Motivation: 现有数学和编程环境依赖专家标注难以扩展，游戏环境学习的技能过于专门化难以泛化，需要构建具备可扩展性、泛化推理和可验证性的理想LLM推理环境。

Method: 提出结构化上下文环境(SIE)框架，利用大规模结构化数据自动构建推理环境，利用其丰富的组合模式支持泛化推理，并通过显式模式和推理链实现基于规则的可验证性。

Result: SIE框架在领域内结构化推理上取得显著提升，学习的组合推理技能能有效泛化到领域外的数学和逻辑推理任务，在信息受限的部分SIE中LLM能通过环境探索推断缺失信息。

Conclusion: SIE框架成功构建了具备可扩展性、泛化性和可验证性的推理环境，显著提升了LLM的推理能力并实现了有效的技能泛化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) via environmental
exploration. As the intrinsic properties of the environment determine the
abilities that LLMs can learn, the environment plays a important role in the RL
finetuning process. An ideal LLM reasoning environment should possess three
core characteristics: scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability.
However, existing mathematical and coding environments are difficult to scale
due to heavy reliance on expert annotation, while the skills learned in
game-based environments are too specialized to generalize. To bridge this gap,
we introduce the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{E}nvironment
(SIE) framework. SIE achieves scalability by automatically constructing
reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, where the rich
compositional patterns naturally support generalizable reasoning. Moreover, the
explicit schemas and reasoning chains in structured data provide a foundation
for rule-based verifiability. Experimental results show that SIE framework not
only achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning, but
also enables the learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize
effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. We
further explored learning in information-limited partial SIEs and found that
LLMs can infer the missing information through exploring the environment,
leading to robust reasoning improvements and generalization performance.

TL;DR: C-Evolve是一种基于共识的提示进化算法，通过多数投票聚合多个提示的输出，使用基于岛屿的进化算法保持种群多样性，以投票分数作为适应度评估个体在群体中的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示进化算法主要关注单个提示的优化，很少有工作探索通过聚合多个提示的结果达成共识是否能进一步提升系统能力边界。

Method: 采用基于岛屿的进化算法维护种群多样性，从不同岛屿选择提示组成群体进行输出聚合，使用投票分数作为适应度评估个体在群体中的贡献。

Result: 在多种任务上取得最先进性能：Qwen3-8B在HotpotQA达到70.67%，IFBench达到43.88%；GPT-4.1-mini在IFBench达到47.96%，MATH达到95.33%。

Conclusion: C-Evolve通过群体共识机制能够产生和维护具有更高潜力形成高性能群体的提示，逐步提升群体性能，展现出竞争优势。

Abstract: Prompt evolution algorithms offer a powerful paradigm for enhancing AI
systems based on closed-source models, while few work explores whether
aggregating results from multiple prompts to reach a consensus can further
advance the system capability boundary. In this paper, we introduce
Consensus-Evolve (C-Evolve), an evolutionary algorithm that discovers a group
of prompts whose aggregated outputs after majority voting achieve optimal
performance. More specifically, C-Evolve employs an island-based evolutionary
algorithm to maintain population diversity, and prompts from distinct islands
are selected to form groups to aggregate their outputs. The key difference from
single individual evolution is a voting score, which evaluates each individual
prompt's contribution within groups. We take this as the fitness score for
evolution instead of individual performance. Consequently, C-Evolve is more
likely to produce and maintain prompts with higher potential to form a
high-performing group and eliminate low-performing ones, gradually improving
the group performance after reaching consensus. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks, including both
open-ended tasks like HotpotQA and closed-ended tasks like MATH. On Qwen3-8B,
C-Evolve achieves 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench, which are 4.95% and
2.73% higher than GEPA, respectively. For GPT-4.1-mini, the accuracy on IFBench
is further improved to 47.96% and reaches 95.33% in the MATH benchmark. These
results demonstrate the C-Evolve's competitive performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM是一个统一的机器遗忘框架，通过在表示空间和参数空间中强制执行双重平滑性来提高鲁棒性和平衡遗忘指标，解决了现有方法中的灾难性遗忘和指标不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，机器遗忘技术需要解决用户隐私、版权侵权和安全问题。但现有最优方法存在灾难性遗忘和指标不平衡问题，往往过度优化一个目标而牺牲其他目标，且容易受到重新学习和越狱攻击。

Method: PRISM框架包含两个平滑优化阶段：(1)表示空间阶段使用鲁棒训练的探针防御越狱攻击；(2)参数空间阶段解耦保留-遗忘梯度冲突，减少不平衡，平滑参数空间以减轻重新学习攻击。

Result: 在WMDP和MUSE数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRISM在对话和连续文本设置下，在多种攻击下优于现有最优基线方法，同时在关键指标间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: PRISM通过双重空间平滑性有效解决了机器遗忘中的鲁棒性和指标平衡问题，为保护用户隐私和模型安全提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, Machine Unlearning has
emerged to address growing concerns around user privacy, copyright
infringement, and overall safety. Yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) unlearning
methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and metric imbalance, for
example by over-optimizing one objective (e.g., unlearning effectiveness,
utility preservation, or privacy protection) at the expense of others. In
addition, small perturbations in the representation or parameter space can be
exploited by relearn and jailbreak attacks. To address these challenges, we
propose PRISM, a unified framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in
representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness and balance
unlearning metrics. PRISM consists of two smoothness optimization stages: (i) a
representation space stage that employs a robustly trained probe to defend
against jailbreak attacks, and (ii) a parameter-space stage that decouples
retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths the parameter
space to mitigate relearning attacks. Extensive experiments on WMDP and MUSE,
across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings, show that PRISM
outperforms SOTA baselines under multiple attacks while achieving a better
balance among key metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了MedCritical框架，通过两阶段自学习机制让小语言模型在医学推理任务上达到接近大模型性能，显著降低了传统知识蒸馏方法的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学领域复杂推理任务中，小语言模型性能不足的问题，同时避免传统基于教师模型的知识蒸馏方法在成本、时间和效率上的挑战。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段从教师模型提取长链思维模板指导学生模型生成复杂推理；第二阶段通过模型自迭代协作的直接偏好优化，让学生模型通过与微调模型的修正轨迹对抗来增强推理能力。

Result: MedCritical 7B模型在CMExam基准上分别超越Taiyi和Huatuo-o1-7B模型3.04%和10.12%，在7B级别小模型中达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 提出的自学习DPO方法能够有效提升小语言模型在医学复杂推理任务上的表现，以较低成本实现与传统知识蒸馏方法相当的效果。

Abstract: In the field of medicine, complex reasoning tasks such as clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and medical knowledge integration pose significant
challenges, where small language models often underperform compared to large
language models like GPT-4 and Deepseek. Recent knowledge distillation-based
methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction,
but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and
efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework,
MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher
model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and
detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the
student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage,
we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration
collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing
against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This
model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own
error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex
problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation
methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model
outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\%
respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among
7B-class small models.

TL;DR: MetaAPO是一个新颖的偏好优化框架，通过元学习器动态耦合数据生成与模型训练，有效解决离线偏好数据与模型策略间的分布不匹配问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在处理离线偏好数据与演化模型策略间的分布不匹配时，往往使用静态启发式或解耦的在线采样策略，无法适应模型的动态学习状态。

Method: 使用轻量级元学习器作为"对齐差距估计器"，评估在线采样相对于离线数据的潜在收益，指导有针对性的在线生成并为优化目标分配样本级元权重。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2、Arena-Hard和MT-Bench上的实验表明，MetaAPO在各种设置下始终优于现有偏好优化方法，同时减少了42%的在线标注成本。

Conclusion: MetaAPO通过动态平衡在线和离线数据的质量与分布，有效解决了偏好优化中的分布不匹配问题，显著提升了性能并降低了成本。

Abstract: Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is
the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the
evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static
heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to
adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose
Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework
that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a
lightweight meta-learner, as an "alignment gap estimator", to evaluate the
potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This
guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the
optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of
online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench
demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference
optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online
annotation costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在放射学中经常生成临床无支持的描述（医学幻觉），这在需要准确性和图像基础输出的医学应用中存在严重风险。

Method: CCD是一个无需训练和检索的推理框架，整合了任务特定放射学专家模型的结构化临床信号，通过双阶段对比机制在生成过程中细化token级logits。

Result: 在三个数据集和多个模型上的实验表明，CCD持续提升了放射学报告生成的总体性能。在MIMIC-CXR数据集上，应用于最先进的RRG模型时，RadGraph-F1提高了17%。

Conclusion: CCD为减轻医学幻觉提供了一个轻量级且可泛化的解决方案，有效连接了放射学中的专家模型和多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language
understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported
descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in
medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through
empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent
in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To
address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free
and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical
signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage
contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby
enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on
three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves
overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR
dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to
state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and
generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively
bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

TL;DR: Guard Vector是一种安全任务向量，通过组合该向量与目标语言模型产生目标防护模型(TGM)，无需额外训练即可提升分类质量并支持多语言扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发一种无需额外训练就能提升语言模型安全防护能力的方法，同时支持多语言扩展和模型可移植性。

Method: 计算防护模型与预训练语言模型的参数差异作为Guard Vector，将其与目标模型组合生成TGM，采用流式感知方法结合前缀训练和单令牌输出分类器。

Result: TGM在标准安全套件上提升了分类质量，支持中文、日文、韩文扩展，无需目标语言标签，在Llama和Gemma骨干网络上具有可移植性。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了数据和计算需求，促进了流式感知评估实践，为构建更负责任的AI生态系统做出了贡献。

Abstract: We introduce Guard Vector, a safety task vector computed as the parameter
difference between a guardrail model (Guard Model) and a same-architecture
pretrained language model. Composing this vector with a target language model
yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware
approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier
that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves
classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety
suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean,
requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also
demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail
backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM
preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior
between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design
increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce
data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation
practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出在单次训练运行中同时进行多个预训练实验的方法，以降低计算成本，并验证了该方法的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的计算成本很高，限制了受控实验的进行，因此需要一种更高效的方法来同时进行多个实验。

Method: 在训练1.5B参数模型的过程中同时进行10个实验，包括数据污染、中毒、记忆化等研究，并测试实验间的交互影响。

Result: 成功复现了多个先前工作的结果，并进行了新研究，实验对模型训练动态和性能影响很小，实验间交互作用可忽略。

Conclusion: 单次训练运行中进行多个预训练实验的方法可以在有限计算预算下实现严谨的大模型科学实验。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that controlled pretraining experiments are a
powerful tool for understanding learning, reasoning, and memorization in large
language models (LLMs). However, the computational cost of pretraining presents
a significant constraint. To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct
multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run.
We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments
during the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only
train a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works
on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel
investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and
watermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the
model acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of
the ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is
minimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a
potential confounder in our approach. We propose to test for interactions with
continual pretraining experiments, finding them to be negligible in our setup.
Overall, our findings suggest that performing multiple pretraining experiments
in a single training run can enable rigorous scientific experimentation with
large models on a compute budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动提示优化方法存在生成不稳定、容易陷入局部最优的问题，且效率较低，需要更有效的优化策略

Method: 提出GRACE框架，包含两个协同策略：门控精炼（引入反馈调节门和更新拒绝门）和自适应压缩（在优化停滞时蒸馏提示核心概念，重构优化轨迹）

Result: 在11个任务上的实验表明，GRACE相比现有最优方法在BIG-Bench Hard、领域特定和通用NLP任务上分别实现了4.7%、4.4%和2.7%的相对性能提升，且仅需25%的提示生成预算

Conclusion: GRACE通过战略性地引入信息损失（精炼和压缩），在性能和效率上都取得了显著提升，证明了该框架的有效性和高效性

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging the full potential of large
language models (LLMs). While automatic prompt optimization offers a scalable
alternative to costly manual design, generating effective prompts remains
challenging. Existing methods often struggle to stably generate improved
prompts, leading to low efficiency, and overlook that prompt optimization
easily gets trapped in local optima. Addressing this, we propose GRACE, a
framework that integrates two synergistic strategies: Gated Refinement and
Adaptive Compression, achieving Efficient prompt optimization. The gated
refinement strategy introduces a feedback regulation gate and an update
rejection gate, which refine update signals to produce stable and effective
prompt improvements. When optimization stagnates, the adaptive compression
strategy distills the prompt's core concepts, restructuring the optimization
trace and opening new paths. By strategically introducing information loss
through refinement and compression, GRACE delivers substantial gains in
performance and efficiency. In extensive experiments on 11 tasks across three
practical domains, including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), domain-specific, and general
NLP tasks, GRACE achieves significant average relative performance improvements
of 4.7%, 4.4% and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Further
analysis shows that GRACE achieves these gains using only 25% of the prompt
generation budget required by prior methods, highlighting its high optimization
efficiency and low computational overhead. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器翻译中文化术语忠实传递的挑战，现有方法只关注文本内解决方案，忽视了专业译者使用的脚注和尾注等副文本工具。

Method: 基于Genette的副文本理论构建包含560个专家对齐副文本的数据集，评估LLM在有/无推理痕迹下的显化选择和内容生成能力，使用内在提示和代理检索方法进行实验。

Result: 人类评估显示LLM生成的副文本能提高受众理解，但效果仍显著低于译者创作；统计分析表明专业译者在使用副文本方面存在很大差异，表明文化调解具有开放性而非规范性。

Conclusion: 副文本显化有潜力推动机器翻译超越语言对等，可扩展到单语解释和个性化适应，展示了文化调解的开放性和多样性特征。

Abstract: The faithful transfer of contextually-embedded meaning continues to challenge
contemporary machine translation (MT), particularly in the rendering of
culture-bound terms--expressions or concepts rooted in specific languages or
cultures, resisting direct linguistic transfer. Existing computational
approaches to explicitating these terms have focused exclusively on in-text
solutions, overlooking paratextual apparatus in the footnotes and endnotes
employed by professional translators. In this paper, we formalize Genette's
(1987) theory of paratexts from literary and translation studies to introduce
the task of paratextual explicitation for MT. We construct a dataset of 560
expert-aligned paratexts from four English translations of the classical
Chinese short story collection Liaozhai and evaluate LLMs with and without
reasoning traces on choice and content of explicitation. Experiments across
intrinsic prompting and agentic retrieval methods establish the difficulty of
this task, with human evaluation showing that LLM-generated paratexts improve
audience comprehension, though remain considerably less effective than
translator-authored ones. Beyond model performance, statistical analysis
reveals that even professional translators vary widely in their use of
paratexts, suggesting that cultural mediation is inherently open-ended rather
than prescriptive. Our findings demonstrate the potential of paratextual
explicitation in advancing MT beyond linguistic equivalence, with promising
extensions to monolingual explanation and personalized adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的发展，它们在自动评分中的应用日益增多。由于LLM具有强大的推理能力，能够提供评分理由，因此比较人类和LLM评分员的理由有助于理解各自的评分推理过程。

Method: 使用大规模测试的作文数据，基于二次加权kappa和归一化互信息评估GPT-4o、Gemini等LLM的评分准确性，使用余弦相似度评估理由相似性，并通过主成分分析探索理由的聚类模式。

Conclusion: 本研究为理解LLM在自动评分中的表现和推理过程提供了重要见解，有助于改进对评分理由的理解和评分一致性的提升。

Abstract: Advances in automated scoring are closely aligned with advances in
machine-learning and natural-language-processing techniques. With recent
progress in large language models (LLMs), the use of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude,
and other generative-AI chatbots for automated scoring has been explored. Given
their strong reasoning capabilities, LLMs can also produce rationales to
support the scores they assign. Thus, evaluating the rationales provided by
both human and LLM raters can help improve the understanding of the reasoning
that each type of rater applies when assigning a score. This study investigates
the rationales of human and LLM raters to identify potential causes of scoring
inconsistency. Using essays from a large-scale test, the scoring accuracy of
GPT-4o, Gemini, and other LLMs is examined based on quadratic weighted kappa
and normalized mutual information. Cosine similarity is used to evaluate the
similarity of the rationales provided. In addition, clustering patterns in
rationales are explored using principal component analysis based on the
embeddings of the rationales. The findings of this study provide insights into
the accuracy and ``thinking'' of LLMs in automated scoring, helping to improve
the understanding of the rationales behind both human scoring and LLM-based
automated scoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型编码了大量事实知识，但由于评估过于严格，许多正确答案因表达形式不同而被误判为错误，导致模型参数知识被低估。

Method: 提出检索约束解码(RCD)策略，限制模型输出为唯一的表面形式，并构建YAGO-QA数据集(19,137个通用知识问题)进行验证。

Result: 在135M到70B参数的开源语言模型上，标准解码低估了模型知识。Llama-3.1-70B在标准解码下F1得分为32.3%，使用RCD提升至46.0%；Llama-3.1-8B使用RCD达到33.0%，超过更大模型的标准解码表现。

Conclusion: RCD方法能更准确地评估语言模型的参数知识，证明现有评估方法确实低估了模型能力，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, but often produce
answers judged as incorrect. We hypothesize that many of these answers are
actually correct, but are expressed in alternative surface forms that are
dismissed due to an overly strict evaluation, leading to an underestimation of
models' parametric knowledge. We propose Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD),
a decoding strategy that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms. We
introduce YAGO-QA, a dataset of 19,137 general knowledge questions. Evaluating
open-source LMs from 135M to 70B parameters, we show that standard decoding
undervalues their knowledge. For instance, Llama-3.1-70B scores only 32.3% F1
with vanilla decoding but 46.0% with RCD. Similarly, Llama-3.1-8B reaches 33.0%
with RCD, outperforming the larger model under vanilla decoding. We publicly
share the code and dataset at https://github.com/Rajjaa/disambiguated-LLM.

Motivation: 当前LLM对齐策略将安全嵌入模型权重，导致控制隐式、静态且难以修改，需要一种更灵活、显式的安全控制方法。

Method: CooT框架包含文本生成器和认知感知器，感知器使用基于优先级的层次化原则检测生成过程中的错位，发现问题时回滚到错误点并在注入指导下重新生成。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型家族上的广泛实验证实，CooT能持续提升安全性和社会推理性能。

Conclusion: CooT将安全对齐转变为在推理过程中活跃的显式、动态、可审计过程，无需重新训练模型即可灵活更新策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but can still exhibit
harmful behaviors. Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into
model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify.
This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time
framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop.
CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that
continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured,
precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to
detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT
intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and
regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with
context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property
into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference,
allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT
consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

Abstract: Item difficulty plays a crucial role in test performance, interpretability of
scores, and equity for all test-takers, especially in large-scale assessments.
Traditional approaches to item difficulty modeling rely on field testing and
classical test theory (CTT)-based item analysis or item response theory (IRT)
calibration, which can be time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, text-based approaches leveraging machine learning and language
models, have emerged as promising alternatives. This paper reviews and
synthesizes 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction in large-scale
assessment settings published through May 2025. For each study, we delineate
the dataset, difficulty parameter, subject domain, item type, number of items,
training and test data split, input, features, model, evaluation criteria, and
model performance outcomes. Results showed that although classic machine
learning models remain relevant due to their interpretability, state-of-the-art
language models, using both small and large transformer-based architectures,
can capture syntactic and semantic patterns without the need for manual feature
engineering. Uniquely, model performance outcomes were summarized to serve as a
benchmark for future research and overall, text-based methods have the
potential to predict item difficulty with root mean square error (RMSE) as low
as 0.165, Pearson correlation as high as 0.87, and accuracy as high as 0.806.
The review concludes by discussing implications for practice and outlining
future research directions for automated item difficulty modeling.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
predictions based on prompts without additional fine-tuning. While prompt
engineering has been widely studied, the impact of role design within prompts
remains underexplored. This study examines the influence of role configurations
in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o from
OpenAI and Llama2-7b and Llama2-13b from Meta. We evaluate the models'
performance across datasets, focusing on tasks like sentiment analysis, text
classification, question answering, and math reasoning. Our findings suggest
the potential of role-based prompt structuring to enhance LLM performance.

Conclusion: 音素感知预训练与有针对性的数据增强策略相结合，能够在音素级别的发音错误检测任务中取得优异表现。

Abstract: This paper describes AraS2P, our speech-to-phonemes system submitted to the
Iqra'Eval 2025 Shared Task. We adapted Wav2Vec2-BERT via Two-Stage training
strategy. In the first stage, task-adaptive continue pretraining was performed
on large-scale Arabic speech-phonemes datasets, which were generated by
converting the Arabic text using the MSA Phonetiser. In the second stage, the
model was fine-tuned on the official shared task data, with additional
augmentation from XTTS-v2-synthesized recitations featuring varied Ayat
segments, speaker embeddings, and textual perturbations to simulate possible
human errors. The system ranked first on the official leaderboard,
demonstrating that phoneme-aware pretraining combined with targeted
augmentation yields strong performance in phoneme-level mispronunciation
detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于阿拉伯语情感分析的主动学习框架，通过LLM辅助标注显著减少标注成本，在三个基准数据集上达到与人工标注相当或更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语情感分析因缺乏高质量标注数据集而进展缓慢，主动学习在其他语言中已证明能减少标注工作量，但在阿拉伯语中研究较少，LLM在阿拉伯语标注中的应用也尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用主动学习框架，评估LSTM、GRU和RNN等深度学习架构，在三个阿拉伯语数据集上比较人工标注和LLM辅助标注两种策略，评估了GPT-4o、Claude 3 Sonnet等五种LLM作为标注器。

Result: LLM辅助的主动学习取得了竞争性或优于人工标注的性能。在Hunger Station数据集上，LSTM模型仅用450个GPT-4o生成的标注样本就达到93%准确率；在MASAC数据集上，DeepSeek Chat用650个标注样本达到82%准确率，与人工标注相当。

Conclusion: LLM辅助的主动学习是阿拉伯语情感分析中降低标注成本的有效方法，能够在不牺牲性能的情况下显著减少标注工作量。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, plays a
vital role in areas like marketing, customer service, and social media
monitoring by providing insights into user opinions and emotions. However,
progress in Arabic sentiment analysis remains limited due to the lack of large,
high-quality labeled datasets. While active learning has proven effective in
reducing annotation efforts in other languages, few studies have explored it in
Arabic sentiment tasks. Likewise, the use of large language models (LLMs) for
assisting annotation and comparing their performance to human labeling is still
largely unexplored in the Arabic context. In this paper, we propose an active
learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis designed to reduce annotation
costs while maintaining high performance. We evaluate multiple deep learning
architectures: Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent
units (GRU), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), across three benchmark
datasets: Hunger Station, AJGT, and MASAC, encompassing both modern standard
Arabic and dialectal variations. Additionally, two annotation strategies are
compared: Human labeling and LLM-assisted labeling. Five LLMs are evaluated as
annotators: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3
70B Instruct. For each dataset, the best-performing LLM was used: GPT-4o for
Hunger Station, Claude 3 Sonnet for AJGT, and DeepSeek Chat for MASAC. Our
results show that LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to human labeling. For example, on the Hunger Station
dataset, the LSTM model achieved 93% accuracy with only 450 labeled samples
using GPT-4o-generated labels, while on the MASAC dataset, DeepSeek Chat
reached 82% accuracy with 650 labeled samples, matching the accuracy obtained
through human labeling.

*Janvijay Singh,Austin Xu,Yilun Zhou,Yefan Zhou,Dilek Hakkani-Tur,Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了微调LLM作为评判模型在实际部署中的三个关键问题：未来兼容性、向后兼容性和问题泛化能力。实验发现在数学领域，未来兼容性最具挑战性，而向后兼容性相对容易实现，DPO训练能持续提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前微调评判模型的标准评估忽略了实际部署中的关键问题，包括对未来模型响应的适应性、对过去模型响应的兼容性以及对未见问题的泛化能力。

Method: 在数学领域构建统一框架，研究不同训练和测试分布，使用三种基于SFT和DPO的微调算法和三种不同基础模型，分析评判模型在三种场景下的表现。

Result: 未来兼容性对大多数模型具有挑战性，向后兼容性相对容易，DPO训练模型性能持续提升。持续学习比仅训练强或弱响应更能平衡适应新旧响应分布的变化。所有模型在从未见过的问题上都出现性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前评判模型不能完全泛化到未见问题，持续学习是应对生成器模型变化的更平衡策略，为实际部署评判模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is widely used in both evaluating free-text model
responses and reward modeling for model alignment and finetuning. Recently,
finetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred
choice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former
achieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to
common biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical
concerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this
paper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of
these judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges
finetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by
future models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well
judges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three
aspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and
test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three
different base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging
for most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with
DPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that
continual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older
and newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker
responses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance
degradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones,
showing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These
findings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and
deploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators.

TL;DR: 提出MoRSD方法，通过选择高质量推理链进行知识蒸馏，提升小语言模型的推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作低估了推理链质量的重要性，主要关注数据量，可能会将噪声或错误信息传递给学生模型

Method: 提出模型导向的推理链选择蒸馏(MoRSD)，通过Rationale Difficulty指标衡量学生模型在给定推理链下生成正确答案的能力，选择高质量推理链

Result: 在三个任务的七个数据集上平均提升4.6%，使用更少但更准确、多样和困难的推理链

Conclusion: 少量高质量推理链比整个数据集更能增强学生模型的推理能力，MoRSD为高效CoT蒸馏提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation aims to enhance small language models'
(SLMs) reasoning by transferring multi-step reasoning capability from the
larger teacher models. However, existing work underestimates rationale quality,
focusing primarily on data quantity, which may transfer noisy or incorrect
information to the student model. To address the above issues, we proposed
\textbf{M}odel-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}ationale \textbf{S}election
\textbf{D}istillation (MoRSD), which can discern and select high quality
rationales for distillation to improve performance further. We further propose
a Rationale Difficulty (RD) metric to measure the ability of the student model
to generate the correct answer under a given rationale. Compared to the
baseline, we achieved 4.6$\%$ average improvement on seven datasets over three
tasks, using fewer rationales by controlling their accuracy, diversity, and
difficulty. Our results reveal that a small portion of the high quality
rationales can enhance the reasoning ability of student models than the entire
dataset. Our method promises to be a possible solution for efficient CoT
distillation. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MoRSD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏开放、真实世界、基于执行的将自然语言查询映射到JQL的基准测试。

Method: 构建包含10万对自然语言请求与验证JQL查询的数据集，每种JQL查询关联四种用户请求类型：长NL、短NL、语义相似和语义精确。

Result: 在Jackal-5K子集上，最佳模型(Gemini 2.5 Pro)在四种用户请求类型上的平均执行准确率仅为60.3%，性能在不同请求类型间差异显著。

Conclusion: Jackal揭示了当前最先进LLM的局限性，并为Jira企业数据的未来研究设定了新的基于执行的挑战。

Abstract: Enterprise teams rely on the Jira Query Language (JQL) to retrieve and filter
issues from Jira. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no open, real-world,
execution-based benchmark for mapping natural language queries to JQL. We
introduce Jackal, a novel, large-scale text-to-JQL benchmark comprising 100,000
natural language (NL) requests paired with validated JQL queries and
execution-based results on a live Jira instance with over 200,000 issues. To
reflect real-world usage, each JQL query is associated with four types of user
requests: (i) Long NL, (ii) Short NL, (iii) Semantically Similar, and (iv)
Semantically Exact. We release Jackal, a corpus of 100,000 text-to-JQL pairs,
together with an execution-based scoring toolkit, and a static snapshot of the
evaluated Jira instance for reproducibility. We report text-to-JQL results on
23 Large Language Models (LLMs) spanning parameter sizes, open and closed
source models, across execution accuracy, exact match, and canonical exact
match. In this paper, we report results on Jackal-5K, a 5,000-pair subset of
Jackal. On Jackal-5K, the best overall model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieves only
60.3% execution accuracy averaged equally across four user request types.
Performance varies significantly across user request types: (i) Long NL
(86.0%), (ii) Short NL (35.7%), (iii) Semantically Similar (22.7%), and (iv)
Semantically Exact (99.3%). By benchmarking LLMs on their ability to produce
correct and executable JQL queries, Jackal exposes the limitations of current
state-of-the-art LLMs and sets a new, execution-based challenge for future
research in Jira enterprise data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐藏层时域信号频域分析的幻觉检测方法HSAD，通过将LLM推理过程建模为认知旅程，使用FFT构建频谱特征来捕捉推理过程中的异常，克服了现有方法在知识覆盖范围和推理偏差检测方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在关键应用场景中部署时，幻觉问题成为重要障碍。现有幻觉检测方法要么受限于知识覆盖范围，要么难以捕捉推理过程中的偏差，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 将LLM推理过程视为随时间展开的认知旅程，通过隐藏层时域信号模拟人类在欺骗检测场景中的信号感知和辨别过程，使用快速傅里叶变换将时域信号映射到频域构建频谱特征，并基于这些特征设计幻觉检测算法。

Result: 频谱特征分析实验证明了该方法的有效性，HSAD方法在检测准确性和鲁棒性方面表现出更高的性能。

Conclusion: HSAD方法通过有效结合推理过程建模和频域特征提取，克服了现有方法在知识覆盖和推理偏差检测方面的限制，为LLM幻觉检测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a
wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the
frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become
a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios.
Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency
verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the
scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning
biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by
signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a
hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden
layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal
\textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's
reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose
modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and
discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal
signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal
signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are
used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis
experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this
approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on
these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By
effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with
frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations
of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of
reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.

Motivation: 后训练过程通常被认为是表面的，虽然提升了利用能力但限制了探索能力，存在关键权衡问题。

Method: 提出Timber方法，通过有针对性的权重增量精炼，部分将Instruct模型恢复回对应的Base模型。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen系列上的实验表明，Timber能持续改进原始Instruct模型，特别是在Pass@k性能上。

Conclusion: 研究为后训练阶段提供了权重层面的新见解，以及无需训练即可精炼Instruct模型的实用策略。

Abstract: Post-training, which elicits a pretrained Base model into the corresponding
Instruct model, is widely considered to be superficial. In this work, we first
reinforce this hypothesis by providing novel quantitative evidence from the
weight level that the effective rank (eRank) remains negligibly changed.
However, this superficiality also suffers a critical trade-off, improving the
exploitation capabilities at the cost of limiting its exploration. To tackle
this issue, we propose Timber, a simple yet effective training-free method that
enhances the exploration capability of the Instruct model while preserving its
exploitation. The key insight is to partially revert Instruct towards the
paired Base model by subtle yet targeted refinement of the weight deltas.
Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series demonstrate that Timber
consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly on Pass@k
performance. Our findings offer new insights into the post-training stage at
the weight level and practical strategies to refine the Instruct model without
training.

Motivation: 传统推理导向的LLMs依赖逐步生成显式标记，效率低下，思维链技术虽然提升性能但增加延迟和标记使用。

Method: 使用训练时的简洁CoT草图学习策略代码本，推理时通过少量连续思维向量进行指导，并引入GainRouter自适应切换快速推理和显式推理。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中达到竞争性或更优的准确率，同时显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: 为大型语言模型提供了一条实现高效可控推理的实用路径。

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on generating
explicit tokens step by step, and their effectiveness typically hinges on
large-scale supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques substantially enhance performance on complex
reasoning tasks, they remain inefficient, requiring long reasoning traces that
increase latency and token usage. In this work, we introduce Latent Codebooks
for Fast Thinking, a framework that uses concise CoT sketches only during
training to learn a codebook of discrete strategy priors. At inference, the
model conditions on a handful of continuous thinking vectors distilled from the
codebook in a single pass, enabling strategy-level guidance without producing
explicit reasoning tokens. To complement this design, we propose GainRouter, a
lightweight routing mechanism that adaptively switches between fast codebook
guided inference and slow explicit reasoning, thereby suppressing overthinking
and reducing unnecessary token generation. Experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while substantially lowering inference cost, offering a practical path
toward efficient and controllable reasoning in large language models.

Motivation: 现有的基于掩码的扩散语言模型难以修正错误的标记，一旦生成就固定不变。关键挑战在于识别输入中的潜在错误。

Result: 实验表明RemeDi在多个数据集上达到了开源扩散语言模型的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 重掩码机制显著提升了基于掩码的扩散语言模型的文本修正能力，实现了更灵活的文本生成和精炼。

Abstract: Mask-based Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) struggle to revise incorrect
tokens: once a token is generated, it typically remains fixed. The key
challenge is to identify potential errors in the inputs. In this paper, we
propose \emph{\underline{Rem}asking-\underline{e}nabled \underline{Di}ffusion
Language Model (RemeDi}, a mask-based DLM that introduces \emph{remasking} as
another fundamental mechanism, enabling more flexible text refinement in
diffusion-based text generation. To achieve this, RemeDi jointly predicts token
distributions and per-token confidence scores at each step. The confidence
scores determine which tokens to be unmasked after the current step, allowing
the model to identify tokens with low quality and remask them. These remasked
tokens can be resampled with richer context in subsequent steps. We design a
remask-aware pipeline to train this ability, including supervised fine-tuning
which teaches the model to detect and remask incorrect tokens in addition to
predict mask tokens, and reinforcement learning which optimizes full generation
trajectories toward higher rewards. Experiments show that RemeDi achieves the
state-of-the-art results among open-source DLMs on multiple datasets.

Motivation: 虽然强化学习在提升复杂推理能力方面表现出色，但其在跨语言泛化方面与监督微调的比较尚未被探索。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-3B-Base作为基础模型，在多种多语言推理基准(数学推理、常识推理、科学推理)上进行实验，比较RL和SFT的表现，并进行机制分析。

Result: RL不仅达到更高准确率，而且展现出比SFT更强的跨语言泛化能力；在非英语数据上训练的RL效果优于英语数据训练，这一现象在SFT中未观察到。

Conclusion: RL使模型具备更鲁棒的推理策略，为更公平有效的多语言推理提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
attracts widespread attention. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
superior performance for improving complex reasoning, its impact on
cross-lingual generalization compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) remains
unexplored. We present the first systematic investigation into cross-lingual
reasoning generalization of RL and SFT. Using Qwen2.5-3B-Base as our foundation
model, we conduct experiments on diverse multilingual reasoning benchmarks,
including math reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and scientific reasoning. Our
investigation yields two significant findings: (1) Tuning with RL not only
achieves higher accuracy but also demonstrates substantially stronger
cross-lingual generalization capabilities compared to SFT. (2) RL training on
non-English data yields better overall performance and generalization than
training on English data, which is not observed with SFT. Furthermore, through
comprehensive mechanistic analyses, we explore the underlying factors of RL's
superiority and generalization across languages. Our results provide compelling
evidence that RL enables the model with more robust reasoning strategies,
offering crucial guidance for more equitable and effective multilingual
reasoning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在英语与非英语语言之间存在显著性能差距（高达29%），这影响了多语言企业应用的可靠性和客户体验，即使使用RAG系统也无法解决。

Method: 使用批量对齐策略进行微调，在每个训练批次中利用语义等价的多语言数据，直接对齐不同语言间的模型输出。

Conclusion: 该方法简单易实现、可扩展，能与现有LLM训练和部署流程无缝集成，为行业提供更稳健和公平的多语言AI解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable for global enterprise
applications due to substantial performance gaps between high-resource and
mid/low-resource languages, driven by English-centric pretraining and internal
reasoning biases. This inconsistency undermines customer experience and
operational reliability in multilingual settings such as customer support,
content moderation, and information retrieval. Even with advanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, we observe up to an 29% accuracy
drop in non-English languages compared to English.
  We propose a practical, batch-wise alignment strategy for fine-tuning LLMs,
leveraging semantically equivalent multilingual data in each training batch to
directly align model outputs across languages. This approach improves
non-English accuracy by up to 23.9\% without compromising English performance,
model reasoning, or retrieval quality. Our method is simple to implement,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码推理基准缺乏形式化的程序中心演绎框架，无法评估模型是否真正理解程序语义还是仅仅利用自然语言和代码标记之间的表面关联。

Method: 引入TF-Bench基准，基于System F类型推断评估LLM推理能力，通过验证转换去除语义无关的自然语言构建TF-Bench_pure纯语义版本，并提出两个新指标评估鲁棒性和测试时推理有效性。

Result: 最先进LLM表现严重受限，最佳模型Claude-3.7-sonnet在TF-Bench_pure上仅达到55.85%准确率。

Conclusion: 当前LLM能力存在关键限制，突出了未来研究的重要方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software
engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities
show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond
mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a
formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are
incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics
or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code
tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to
as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove
semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely
semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial
limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM
(Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure.
Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the
effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in
current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估多模态大语言模型在复杂人类环境中进行细致推理和决策的能力仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 构建VIVA+基准测试，包含三个核心能力维度：基础情境理解、上下文驱动的行动论证和反思性推理。

Result: 评估了最新的商业和开源模型，揭示了不同的性能模式并识别了显著挑战。针对性训练和多步推理策略能带来一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 深入分析揭示了当前模型的局限性，为推进多模态大语言模型在现实环境中实现更稳健、上下文感知和社交熟练的决策提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results for embodied
agents in operating meaningfully in complex, human-centered environments. Yet,
evaluating their capacity for nuanced, human-like reasoning and decision-making
remains challenging. In this work, we introduce VIVA+, a cognitively grounded
benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and decision-making of MLLMs in
human-centered situations. VIVA+ consists of 1,317 real-world situations paired
with 6,373 multiple-choice questions, targeting three core abilities for
decision-making: (1) Foundational Situation Comprehension, (2) Context-Driven
Action Justification, and (3) Reflective Reasoning. Together, these dimensions
provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to perceive,
reason, and act in socially meaningful ways. We evaluate the latest commercial
and open-source models on VIVA+, where we reveal distinct performance patterns
and highlight significant challenges. We further explore targeted training and
multi-step reasoning strategies, which yield consistent performance
improvements. Finally, our in-depth analysis highlights current model
limitations and provides actionable insights for advancing MLLMs toward more
robust, context-aware, and socially adept decision-making in real-world
settings.

*Zhiqiang Liu,Yichi Zhang,Mengshu Sun,Lei Liang,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出M-Hyper方法解决多模态知识图谱补全问题，通过四元数代数实现融合模态和独立模态的共存协作，克服了现有方法的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKGC方法存在两种范式：融合方法会丢失模态特定信息且缺乏灵活性，集成方法难以捕捉模态间的语义交互。需要克服这两种方法的双重局限

Method: 使用四元数代数，四个正交基表示多个独立模态，Hamilton积建模模态间交互。包含细粒度实体表示分解模块和鲁棒关系感知模态融合模块

Result: 在广泛实验中表现出最先进的性能、鲁棒性和计算效率

Conclusion: M-Hyper方法成功实现了融合和独立模态表示的共存协作，有效平衡了跨模态交互和模态特定信息保留

Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover missing facts
in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging both structural
relationships and diverse modality information of entities. Existing MMKGC
methods follow two multi-modal paradigms: fusion-based and ensemble-based.
Fusion-based methods employ fixed fusion strategies, which inevitably leads to
the loss of modality-specific information and a lack of flexibility to adapt to
varying modality relevance across contexts. In contrast, ensemble-based methods
retain modality independence through dedicated sub-models but struggle to
capture the nuanced, context-dependent semantic interplay between modalities.
To overcome these dual limitations, we propose a novel MMKGC method M-Hyper,
which achieves the coexistence and collaboration of fused and independent
modality representations. Our method integrates the strengths of both
paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal interactions while maintaining
modality-specific information. Inspired by ``quaternion'' algebra, we utilize
its four orthogonal bases to represent multiple independent modalities and
employ the Hamilton product to efficiently model pair-wise interactions among
them. Specifically, we introduce a Fine-grained Entity Representation
Factorization (FERF) module and a Robust Relation-aware Modality Fusion (R2MF)
module to obtain robust representations for three independent modalities and
one fused modality. The resulting four modality representations are then mapped
to the four orthogonal bases of a biquaternion (a hypercomplex extension of
quaternion) for comprehensive modality interaction. Extensive experiments
indicate its state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and computational
efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型在罗马尼亚驾驶法规问答任务中的表现，构建了包含1208个问题（387个多模态）的数据集，比较了纯文本和多模态SOTA系统，并分析了领域特定微调对Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct和RoLlama 3.1-8B-Instruct的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保新老驾驶员掌握当前交通规则对道路安全至关重要，需要评估LLMs在罗马尼亚驾驶法规问答中的表现，特别是对于资源较少的语言。

Method: 构建罗马尼亚驾驶法规问答数据集，比较纯文本和多模态SOTA系统，对8B模型进行领域特定微调，使用LLM-as-a-Judge评估解释质量。

Result: SOTA模型表现良好，但微调后的8B模型具有竞争力；图像文本描述优于直接视觉输入；LLM-as-a-Judge评估显示存在自偏好偏差。

Abstract: Ensuring that both new and experienced drivers master current traffic rules
is critical to road safety. This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs)
on Romanian driving-law QA with explanation generation. We release a
1{,}208-question dataset (387 multimodal) and compare text-only and multimodal
SOTA systems, then measure the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning for Llama
3.1-8B-Instruct and RoLlama 3.1-8B-Instruct. SOTA models perform well, but
fine-tuned 8B models are competitive. Textual descriptions of images outperform
direct visual input. Finally, an LLM-as-a-Judge assesses explanation quality,
revealing self-preference bias. The study informs explainable QA for
less-resourced languages.

### [82] [Compose and Fuse: Revisiting the Foundational Bottlenecks in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23744)
*Yucheng Wang,Yifan Hou,Aydin Javadov,Mubashara Akhtar,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在跨模态推理方面存在挑战，研究发现额外模态只有在提供独立且充分的推理路径时才能提升性能，而冗余或链式推理支持往往会损害性能。主要存在任务组合瓶颈和融合瓶颈两个核心问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的跨模态推理研究存在不一致的结果，缺乏受控评估框架和对模型内部机制的分析，无法明确模态交互何时以及为何支持或损害推理性能。

Method: 采用基于逻辑的评估框架，将多模态推理分为六种交互模式，分析事实在不同模态间的分布和逻辑组合方式。通过注意力模式分析和两步提示策略来验证瓶颈问题。

Result: 额外模态仅在提供独立充分推理路径时提升性能；推理性能在三种系统方式下退化；注意力模式未能编码事实有用性；两步提示策略可恢复性能；早期融合中的注意力软化可改善推理。

Conclusion: 多模态推理的主要障碍是集成而非感知，建议采用组合感知训练和早期融合控制作为有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise enhanced reasoning by
integrating diverse inputs such as text, vision, and audio. Yet cross-modal
reasoning remains underexplored, with conflicting reports on whether added
modalities help or harm performance. These inconsistencies stem from a lack of
controlled evaluation frameworks and analysis of models' internals to isolate
when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning. We address
this gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes
multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are
distributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional
modalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient
reasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts
performance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker
modalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward
certain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be
integrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures:
task-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly
executed in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces
bias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode
fact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason)
restores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck. Moreover,
modality identity remains recoverable in early layers, and softening attention
in early fusion improves reasoning, highlighting biased fusion as another
failure mode. Overall, our findings show that integration, not perception, is
the main barrier to multimodal reasoning, suggesting composition-aware training
and early fusion control as promising directions.

### [83] [Understanding Textual Capability Degradation in Speech LLMs via Parameter Importance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23755)
*Chao Wang,Rui-Chen Zheng,Yang Ai,Zhen-Hua Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文分析了语音集成到大型语言模型中导致文本能力下降的问题，提出了基于参数重要性估计的分析框架，发现语音微调会扰乱文本推理的关键参数分布，并通过分层学习率调度和LoRA方法有效缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音集成到LLMs中虽然扩展了模型能力，但往往削弱了其核心文本能力，限制了模型利用预训练文本知识的能力。

Method: 提出基于参数重要性估计的分析框架，研究编码器-适配器范式，并采用分层学习率调度和低秩适应(LoRA)两种策略来保持原始参数分布。

Result: 实验结果显示，两种方法都比完全微调更好地保持了文本能力，同时提高了下游口语问答性能。

Conclusion: 该分析为所提缓解策略的有效性提供了原则性解释，将其优势与LLMs中文本知识的结构特性联系起来。

Abstract: The integration of speech into Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially
expanded their capabilities, but often at the cost of weakening their core
textual competence. This degradation limits the ability of speech-enabled LLMs
to fully exploit their pre-trained text-based knowledge. In this work, we
analyze the underlying mechanisms of this issue through a focused study of the
widely used encoder-adaptor paradigm. We propose an analytical framework based
on parameter importance estimation, which reveals that fine-tuning for speech
introduces a textual importance distribution shift: the layer-wise allocation
of parameters critical to textual reasoning is disrupted. Building on this
insight, we investigate two mitigation strategies: layer-wise learning rate
scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), both aim to preserve the original
parameter distribution. Experimental results show that both approaches better
maintain textual competence than full fine-tuning, while also improving
downstream spoken question answering performance. Furthermore, our analysis
offers a principled explanation for the effectiveness of the proposed
mitigation strategies, linking their benefits to the structural properties of
textual knowledge in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了KLCF框架，通过知识一致性强化学习解决LLM长文本生成中的幻觉问题，无需外部知识，提升事实准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法主要依赖偏好奖励，但忽视了模型的内部知识边界，加剧了"幻觉税"问题，需要更有效的方法来提升长文本生成的事实性

Method: KLCF框架关注策略模型表达知识与基础模型参数知识的一致性，采用双事实对齐机制联合优化事实召回和精度，利用预训练知识边界构建事实清单指导在线强化学习

Result: 实验结果显示KLCF在多个长文本基准测试中显著提升事实性指标，有效缓解模型幻觉问题

Conclusion: KLCF框架通过知识一致性强化学习，在不依赖外部知识的情况下有效提升LLM长文本生成的事实性，具有高效和可扩展性

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability
of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference
rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries,
exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we
propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a
novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy
model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and
introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall
and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to
construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve
factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module
based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision
during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or
heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and
lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training.
Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality
metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model
hallucinations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LoGo框架解决LLM个性化中的冷启动和偏见问题，通过结合个性化本地记忆和集体全局记忆，并引入调解器模块来协调两者差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM个性化面临两个关键挑战：冷启动问题（用户历史数据不足）和偏见问题（用户历史数据丰富但偏斜），这些问题源于无法建模用户间的集体知识

Method: 提出本地-全局记忆框架(LoGo)，结合个性化本地记忆和捕获群体共享兴趣的集体全局记忆，并引入调解器模块来解决本地和全局信号之间的冲突

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LoGo通过预热冷启动用户和减轻偏见预测，持续提升个性化质量

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了整合集体知识对于增强LLM个性化的重要性

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to tailor model behavior to
individual users based on their historical interactions. However, its
effectiveness is often hindered by two key challenges: the \textit{cold-start
problem}, where users with limited history provide insufficient context for
accurate personalization, and the \textit{biasing problem}, where users with
abundant but skewed history cause the model to overfit to narrow preferences.
We identify both issues as symptoms of a common underlying limitation, i.e.,
the inability to model collective knowledge across users. To address this, we
propose a local-global memory framework (LoGo) that combines the personalized
local memory with a collective global memory that captures shared interests
across the population. To reconcile discrepancies between these two memory
sources, we introduce a mediator module designed to resolve conflicts between
local and global signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by both
warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions. These results
highlight the importance of incorporating collective knowledge to enhance LLM
personalization.

*Yoonah Park,Haesung Pyun,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了KAPPA方法，通过投影调整来对齐LLMs在多项选择题中的知识坐标和预测坐标，从而解决知识-预测差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多项选择题中经常出错，尽管在其他情境下能展示正确知识。研究者希望理解这种知识-预测差距的机制并缓解它。

Method: 通过探测分析发现残差流中存在两个重要基向量：知识基和预测基。KAPPA方法通过投影变换将隐藏状态对齐到知识坐标上。

Result: 在Big-Bench-Hard和ARC-Challenge的二元选择重构任务上，KAPPA显著提高了准确率，并持续优于基线方法。该方法还能扩展到非选择题。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对知识-预测差距的新几何理解，并提出了一种实用的方法来更好地对齐模型行为与其潜在知识。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
despite demonstrating correct knowledge in other contexts, such as free-form
generation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this knowledge-prediction
gap on MCQs and alleviate it, we conduct a probing analysis and find that
residual streams in certain layers contain a subspace spanned by two important
bases: a \emph{knowledge basis} that encodes the probability of the
ground-truth answer for a given MCQ and a \emph{prediction basis} that encodes
the probability of the answer choice predicted by the model. We observe that
incorrect predictions arise from a misalignment of the model's hidden states
along these two bases. Hence, we introduce \textbf{KAPPA} (Knowledge-Aligned
Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free intervention
that transforms the hidden states to align the prediction coordinate with the
knowledge coordinate within this subspace. Experiments on binary-choice
reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA
substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms baselines. While
optimal subspaces differ across tasks, subspaces generalize to some extent, as
supported by cross-dataset experiments. Moreover, KAPPA extends its
effectiveness to free-form questions beyond MCQs. Our work provides a new
geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical
method for better aligning model behavior with its latent knowledge.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to the QIAS 2025 shared task on Islamic
knowledge understanding and reasoning. We developed a hybrid
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that combines sparse and dense
retrieval methods with cross-encoder reranking to improve large language model
(LLM) performance. Our three-stage pipeline incorporates BM25 for initial
retrieval, a dense embedding retrieval model for semantic matching, and
cross-encoder reranking for precise content retrieval. We evaluate our approach
on both subtasks using two LLMs, Fanar and Mistral, demonstrating that the
proposed RAG pipeline enhances performance across both, with accuracy
improvements up to 25%, depending on the task and model configuration. Our best
configuration is achieved with Fanar, yielding accuracy scores of 45% in
Subtask 1 and 80% in Subtask 2.

TL;DR: 提出了OpenBiasBench基准和Open-DeBias方法，用于检测和缓解LLM在QA任务中的开放集偏见，包括已知和未见偏见，在BBQ数据集上显著提升性能并展示多语言泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见缓解方法局限于预定义类别，无法处理新颖或上下文特定的新兴偏见，需要开发能够检测和缓解开放集偏见的方法。

Method: 提出Open-DeBias方法，使用适配器模块进行数据高效和参数高效的偏见缓解，能够同时处理现有社会偏见和泛化到未见偏见。

Result: 相比BMBI方法，在BBQ数据集上模糊子集准确率提升48%，消歧子集提升6%，在韩语BBQ上零样本迁移达到84%准确率，展示强大语言无关泛化能力。

Conclusion: Open-DeBias方法在多种NLP任务中验证了有效性，具有鲁棒性、多语言优势和适用于通用开放域偏见缓解的适用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on question
answering (QA) tasks, yet they often encode harmful biases that compromise
fairness and trustworthiness. Most existing bias mitigation approaches are
restricted to predefined categories, limiting their ability to address novel or
context-specific emergent biases. To bridge this gap, we tackle the novel
problem of open-set bias detection and mitigation in text-based QA. We
introduce OpenBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases
across a wide range of categories and subgroups, encompassing both known and
previously unseen biases. Additionally, we propose Open-DeBias, a novel,
data-efficient, and parameter-efficient debiasing method that leverages adapter
modules to mitigate existing social and stereotypical biases while generalizing
to unseen ones. Compared to the state-of-the-art BMBI method, Open-DeBias
improves QA accuracy on BBQ dataset by nearly $48\%$ on ambiguous subsets and
$6\%$ on disambiguated ones, using adapters fine-tuned on just a small fraction
of the training data. Remarkably, the same adapters, in a zero-shot transfer to
Korean BBQ, achieve $84\%$ accuracy, demonstrating robust language-agnostic
generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we also validate the
effectiveness of Open-DeBias across a broad range of NLP tasks, including
StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs, highlighting its robustness, multilingual strength,
and suitability for general-purpose, open-domain bias mitigation. The project

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPELL是一个多角色自博弈强化学习框架，用于无标签优化长文本推理能力，通过问题生成、回答和验证三个角色实现自我改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长文本推理在大型语言模型中的进展滞后，主要由于长文本处理的内在困难以及缺乏可靠的人工标注和可编程验证的奖励信号。

Method: SPELL框架集成三个循环角色：问题生成器从原始文档生成问题，回答器学习基于文档回答问题，验证器评估回答与参考答案的语义等价性，产生奖励信号指导持续训练。

Result: 在六个长文本基准测试中，SPELL持续提升不同LLM的性能，优于同等规模模型在大规模标注数据上的微调结果，在Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking模型上平均提升7.6点pass@8分数。

Conclusion: SPELL展示了通过自博弈强化学习有效提升长文本推理能力的潜力，为扩展到更强大模型提供了希望。

Abstract: Progress in long-context reasoning for large language models (LLMs) has
lagged behind other recent advances. This gap arises not only from the
intrinsic difficulty of processing long texts, but also from the scarcity of
reliable human annotations and programmatically verifiable reward signals. In
this paper, we propose SPELL, a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning
framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context
reasoning. SPELL integrates three cyclical roles-questioner, responder, and
verifier-within a single model to enable continual self-improvement. The
questioner generates questions from raw documents paired with reference
answers; the responder learns to solve these questions based on the documents;
and the verifier evaluates semantic equivalence between the responder's output
and the questioner's reference answer, producing reward signals to guide
continual training. To stabilize training, we introduce an automated curriculum
that gradually increases document length and a reward function that adapts
question difficulty to the model's evolving capabilities. Extensive experiments
on six long-context benchmarks show that SPELL consistently improves
performance across diverse LLMs and outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned
on large-scale annotated data. Notably, SPELL achieves an average 7.6-point
gain in pass@8 on the strong reasoning model Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, raising
its performance ceiling and showing promise for scaling to even more capable
models.

TL;DR: 提出了Q-Tuning框架，通过联合优化样本级和token级剪枝，在仅使用12.5%训练数据的情况下，在SmolLM2-1.7B上实现了比全数据SFT基线平均提升38%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着监督微调成为计算密集型阶段，现有数据剪枝方法存在设计碎片化问题，无法同时优化样本和token两个维度，导致效率低下。

Method: 引入错误-不确定性平面诊断框架，提出Q-Tuning两阶段策略：先进行样本级筛选保留富含信息性错误或校准信号的样本，然后应用非对称token剪枝策略，仅对错误样本修剪不重要的token。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试中达到新的SOTA，在SmolLM2-1.7B上仅使用12.5%数据即实现+38%平均提升。

Conclusion: Q-Tuning是首个持续超越全数据训练的动态剪枝方法，为预算受限的LLM SFT提供了实用且可扩展的数据利用方案。

Abstract: As supervised fine-tuning (SFT) evolves from a lightweight post-training step
into a compute-intensive phase rivaling mid-training in scale, data efficiency
has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight
budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they
operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to
jointly optimize both dimensions. This disconnect leads to significant
inefficiencies--high-value samples may still contain redundant tokens, while
token-level pruning often discards crucial instructional or corrective signals
embedded in individual examples. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the
Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes
the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by
this insight, we propose Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning), a unified framework
that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning. Q-Tuning
employs a two-stage strategy: first, it performs sample-level triage to retain
examples rich in informative misconceptions or calibration signals; second, it
applies an asymmetric token-pruning policy, using a context-aware scoring
mechanism to trim less salient tokens exclusively from misconception samples
while preserving calibration samples in their entirety. Our method sets a new
state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B,
Q-Tuning achieves a +38\% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline
using only 12.5\% of the original training data. As the first dynamic pruning
approach to consistently outperform full-data training, Q-Tuning provides a
practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in
budget-constrained LLM SFT.

TL;DR: DocPruner是一个用于视觉文档检索的框架，通过自适应剪枝技术减少多向量模型存储开销50-60%，同时保持检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大视觉语言模型的多向量方法虽然有效，但存储开销巨大，每个文档需要存储数百个向量，在大规模部署时成本高昂且不实用。

Method: 利用文档内补丁注意力分布动态识别和丢弃冗余嵌入，实现自适应补丁级嵌入剪枝。

Result: 在十余个代表性数据集上的实验表明，DocPruner能显著减少存储开销，同时检索性能下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: DocPruner为构建存储高效的大规模视觉文档检索系统提供了稳健、灵活且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), the task of retrieving visually-rich
document pages using queries that combine visual and textual cues, is crucial
for numerous real-world applications. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in a multi-vector paradigm, representing
each document as patch-level embeddings to capture fine-grained details. While
highly effective, this approach introduces a critical challenge: prohibitive
storage overhead, as storing hundreds of vectors per page makes large-scale
deployment costly and impractical. To address this, we introduce DocPruner, the
first framework to employ adaptive patch-level embedding pruning for VDR to
effectively reduce the storage overhead. DocPruner leverages the intra-document
patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant
embeddings for each document. This adaptive mechanism enables a significant
50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible
degradation in document retrieval performance. Extensive experiments across
more than ten representative datasets validate that DocPruner offers a robust,
flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale
VDR systems.

Conclusion: EOSER、ASS和CJ-GRPO方法为有效高效地驯化掩码扩散语言模型提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as
parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer
inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored.
A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR
models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive
transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding
strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they
outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL
algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a
training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal
(parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and
the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early
Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which
unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding,
achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we
introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO)
for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory
and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by
skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks,
such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The
results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with
CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs.

*Zhangdie Yuan,Zifeng Ding,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EVOLVECAST框架评估LLMs在新信息出现时是否适当调整预测，发现LLMs的更新往往不一致或过于保守，置信度估计远未达到人类标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将未来事件预测视为静态任务，未考虑随着新证据出现，预测及其置信度应如何演变。

Method: 引入EVOLVECAST框架，评估LLMs在训练截止后发布的新信息面前是否修订预测，以人类预测者作为比较参考。

Result: LLMs对新信息有一定响应性，但更新往往不一致或过于保守；口头和基于logits的置信度估计均未显著优于对方，且都远未达到人类标准。

Conclusion: 模型倾向于表达保守偏见，需要更稳健的信念更新方法。

Abstract: Prior work has largely treated future event prediction as a static task,
failing to consider how forecasts and the confidence in them should evolve as
new evidence emerges. To address this gap, we introduce EVOLVECAST, a framework
for evaluating whether large language models appropriately revise their
predictions in response to new information. In particular, EVOLVECAST assesses
whether LLMs adjust their forecasts when presented with information released
after their training cutoff. We use human forecasters as a comparative
reference to analyze prediction shifts and confidence calibration under updated
contexts. While LLMs demonstrate some responsiveness to new information, their
updates are often inconsistent or overly conservative. We further find that
neither verbalized nor logits-based confidence estimates consistently
outperform the other, and both remain far from the human reference standard.
Across settings, models tend to express conservative bias, underscoring the
need for more robust approaches to belief updating.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Easy Turn，一个开源的、模块化的轮次转换检测模型，集成声学和语言双模态信息来预测四种对话轮次状态，并发布了1145小时的训练数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全双工交互对于自然人机通信至关重要，但现有解决方案要么依赖未开源的专用轮次转换模型，要么参数规模大或仅支持单模态，要么需要大量稀缺的全双工数据。

Method: 开发了集成声学和语言双模态信息的模块化轮次转换检测模型，预测四种对话状态：完成、未完成、反馈和等待。

Result: 在开源测试集上实现了最先进的轮次转换检测准确率，优于现有的开源模型如TEN Turn Detection和Smart Turn V2。

Conclusion: Easy Turn模型和Easy Turn trainset数据集将公开发布在GitHub上，为解决全双工交互中的轮次转换检测问题提供了开源解决方案。

Abstract: Full-duplex interaction is crucial for natural human-machine communication,
yet remains challenging as it requires robust turn-taking detection to decide
when the system should speak, listen, or remain silent. Existing solutions
either rely on dedicated turn-taking models, most of which are not
open-sourced. The few available ones are limited by their large parameter size
or by supporting only a single modality, such as acoustic or linguistic.
Alternatively, some approaches finetune LLM backbones to enable full-duplex
capability, but this requires large amounts of full-duplex data, which remain
scarce in open-source form. To address these issues, we propose Easy Turn, an
open-source, modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and
linguistic bimodal information to predict four dialogue turn states: complete,
incomplete, backchannel, and wait, accompanied by the release of Easy Turn
trainset, a 1,145-hour speech dataset designed for training turn-taking
detection models. Compared to existing open-source models like TEN Turn
Detection and Smart Turn V2, our model achieves state-of-the-art turn-taking
detection accuracy on our open-source Easy Turn testset. The data and model
will be made publicly available on GitHub.

*Claudio Fantinuoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了视觉基础口译(VGI)方法，通过整合视觉语言模型处理语音和网络摄像头视觉输入，利用上下文视觉信息来改进机器口译系统的翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器口译系统仅依赖单一的语言信号模态，在需要视觉、情境或语用信息进行消歧和充分翻译的语境中表现受限。

Method: 开发了一个原型系统，集成视觉语言模型处理语音和网络摄像头视觉输入，构建了针对三种歧义类型的手工诊断语料库进行评估。

Result: 视觉基础显著改善了词汇消歧，在性别解析方面获得了适度但不稳定的提升，对句法歧义没有明显益处。

Conclusion: 采用多模态方法是提升机器口译翻译质量的必要步骤。

Abstract: Machine Interpreting systems are currently implemented as unimodal, real-time
speech-to-speech architectures, processing translation exclusively on the basis
of the linguistic signal. Such reliance on a single modality, however,
constrains performance in contexts where disambiguation and adequacy depend on
additional cues, such as visual, situational, or pragmatic information. This
paper introduces Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI), a novel approach designed
to address the limitations of unimodal machine interpreting. We present a
prototype system that integrates a vision-language model to process both speech
and visual input from a webcam, with the aim of priming the translation process
through contextual visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of this
approach, we constructed a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus targeting three types
of ambiguity. In our evaluation, visual grounding substantially improves
lexical disambiguation, yields modest and less stable gains for gender
resolution, and shows no benefit for syntactic ambiguities. We argue that
embracing multimodality represents a necessary step forward for advancing
translation quality in machine interpreting.

TL;DR: HiPO框架通过混合策略优化实现自适应推理控制，让LLM选择性使用详细推理或直接回答，在保持准确性的同时显著减少token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在复杂任务中总是生成冗长的推理链，导致token使用过多和推理成本过高，需要更高效的推理控制方法。

Method: 结合混合数据管道（提供成对的详细推理和直接回答）与混合强化学习奖励系统，平衡准确性和效率，避免过度依赖详细推理。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，HiPO能显著减少token长度，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: HiPO为高效自适应推理提供了原则性方法，有助于推理导向型LLM在资源敏感的实际场景中的部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating
lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and
higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization
(i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to
selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to
respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data
pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid
reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency
while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across
mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially
reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope
HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing
the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive
settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ByteSized32Refactored，一个重构、模块化且可扩展的文本游戏生成实现，通过创建GameBasic.py基础库和7个基类，将代码量从2万行减少到1万行，提高了可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟交互式世界模型仍然是大型语言模型的核心挑战，需要更高效、可扩展的文本游戏生成方法。

Method: 重构ByteSized32代码结构，创建GameBasic.py基础库，抽象出7个基类（如GameObject等）作为可复用模块，实现模块化和集中化设计。

Result: 使用GPT-4o进行实验，在未见过的场景中生成的文本游戏在四个评估维度中的两个维度上质量有所提升，但在另外两个维度上有所下降，表明重构代码的分层结构给LLM带来了新的挑战。

Conclusion: 可扩展的代码结构以基础库和模块化优化为中心，不仅促进了LLM对环境规范的适应，还建立了一个支持未来扩展的可扩展环境。

Abstract: Simulating interactive world models remains a core challenge in Large
Language Models(LLMs). In this work, we introduce the ByteSized32Refactored, a
refactored, modular, and extensible implementation of the original ByteSized32
corpus to explore the task of text game generation. We further optimize the
code structure of each text game and create the GameBasic.py foundation
library, which centralizes common logic across all 32 games by abstracting 7
base classes (GameObject, etc.) into reusable modules, thereby reducing from
20k to 10k total lines of Python code compared to the original Bytesized32. Our
refactored implementation enables extendability - with our centralized design,
ByteSized32Refactored can be more efficiently extended to include text games of
new scenarios and specifications by reusing the shared logic and
functionalities. Extensive experiments with GPT-4o demonstrate a mix of
performance - with Bytesized32Refactored, the generated text games for unseen
scenarios showcase quality improvements on two of the four evaluation
dimensions while decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical
structure of the refactored code presents new challenges for LLMs. Overall, we
highlight that our extensible code structure, centered on the foundation
library and the modular optimization, not only facilitates LLM adaptation to
environment specifications but also establishes a scalable environment that
supports future extensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好对齐方法需要大量人工标注数据和昂贵的参数优化，导致任务特定的固化模型。PaLRS旨在提供更高效、灵活的无训练替代方案。

Method: 从少量偏好对中提取残差流中的偏好信号，生成轻量级即插即用导向向量，在推理时应用这些向量来引导模型行为。

Result: 在中小型开源LLM上，PaLRS在数学推理和代码生成任务上表现一致提升，同时保持基线通用性能，相比DPO方法性能更好且节省大量时间。

Conclusion: PaLRS为偏好对齐提供了一种高效、灵活的无训练替代方案，只需最少数据即可实现即插即用的对齐机制。

Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models
(LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization
typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of
parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this
work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual
Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals
encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference
pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be
applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We
evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that
PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and
code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose
performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better
with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective,
much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference
optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for
alignment with minimal data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速扩展引发了对其计算和环境成本的担忧，需要研究如何在保持翻译质量的同时提高效率。

Method: 使用Flores+基准测试和人类对话翻译评估，比较完整3.3B fp32模型、蒸馏模型和量化模型在法语、印地语和卡纳达语上的表现，并分析碳排放。

Result: 完整3.3B模型BLEU得分最高但环境足迹最大（每次评估约0.007-0.008 kg CO2）；蒸馏模型推理速度比完整模型快4.5倍，BLEU得分下降很小；即使是激进的INT4量化也能保持高准确性和流畅度。

Conclusion: 模型压缩策略能显著减少计算需求和环境影响，同时保持竞争力的翻译质量，但在低资源环境中权衡更明显。主张将效率和可持续性作为NLP进展的核心评估维度。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about their computational and environmental costs. This study investigates the
trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency by comparing full-scale,
distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as a case study. We
evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of
conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis of
carbon emissions per evaluation run revealed that the full 3.3B fp32 model,
while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental
footprint (about 0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled models achieved an
inference of up to 4.5x faster than the full 3.3B model, with only minimal
reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations also showed that even aggressive
quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with
differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that
model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and
environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though
trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings. We argue for
evaluation frameworks that integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside
objective metrics as central dimensions of progress in NLP.

Motivation: 随着自主AI代理在工业中的广泛应用，需要确保其安全性，解决策略到实践之间的差距，实现可验证的安全和可监管的AI。

Method: 引入"策略即提示"方法，使用LLM解释自然语言策略，构建可验证策略树，编译为轻量级提示分类器，在运行时审计代理行为。

Result: 在多样化应用中验证了该方法，展示了可扩展和可审计的管道，能够有效弥合策略与实践之间的关键差距。

Conclusion: 该框架为实现可验证更安全和更可监管的AI铺平了道路，通过自动化策略实施解决了AI代理的安全保障问题。

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in industry, it is
essential to safeguard them. We introduce a novel framework that automates the
translation of unstructured design documents into verifiable, real-time
guardrails. We introduce "Policy as Prompt," a new approach that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and enforce natural language policies by
applying contextual understanding and the principle of least privilege. Our
system first ingests technical artifacts to construct a verifiable policy tree,
which is then compiled into lightweight, prompt-based classifiers that audit
agent behavior at runtime. We validate our approach across diverse
applications, demonstrating a scalable and auditable pipeline that bridges the
critical policy-to-practice gap, paving the way for verifiably safer and more
regulatable AI.

TL;DR: 提出了MCPMark基准测试，用于更全面、真实地评估MCP在复杂工作流中的表现，包含127个高质量任务，要求丰富的CRUD操作交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MCP基准测试范围狭窄，主要关注读取密集型任务或交互深度有限的任务，无法捕捉真实世界工作流的复杂性和现实性。

Method: 创建了127个由领域专家和AI代理协作设计的高质量任务，每个任务包含精心设计的初始状态和程序化验证脚本，要求丰富的环境交互和CRUD操作。使用最小化代理框架在工具调用循环中进行全面评估。

Result: 表现最佳的gpt-5-medium模型仅达到52.56% pass@1和33.86% pass^4，其他强模型如claude-sonnet-4和o3低于30% pass@1和15% pass^4。平均每个任务需要16.2次执行轮次和17.4次工具调用。

Conclusion: MCPMark突显了现有MCP基准测试的局限性，展示了其压力测试特性，表明当前LLM在复杂、真实的MCP任务中仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: MCP standardizes how LLMs interact with external systems, forming the
foundation for general agents. However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow
in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction
depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows.
To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP
use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of $127$
high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents.
Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic
script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse
interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read,
update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a
tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model,
gpt-5-medium, reaches only $52.56$\% pass@1 and $33.86$\% pass^4, while other
widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below
$30$\% pass@1 and $15$\% pass^4. On average, LLMs require $16.2$ execution
turns and $17.4$ tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in
previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark.

TL;DR: 提出了序列扩散语言模型（SDLM），通过下一序列预测（NSP）统一了下一词和下一块预测，能够自适应确定生成长度，在保持KV缓存兼容性的同时提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型具有理论效率优势，但受到固定长度解码和与KV缓存不兼容的限制。块扩散虽然缓解了这些问题，但仍需要固定块大小和昂贵的训练。

Method: 基于下一序列预测（NSP）构建序列扩散语言模型（SDLM），在固定大小的掩码块内进行扩散推理，但根据模型置信度动态解码连续子序列。

Result: SDLM仅使用350万训练样本就能匹配或超越强自回归基线，同时比Qwen-2.5实现2.1倍吞吐量。SDLM-32B模型显示出更强的效率增益。

Conclusion: 该建模范式具有强大的可扩展性潜力，能够在保持KV缓存兼容性的同时显著提高语言模型的生成效率。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have strong theoretical efficiency but are
limited by fixed-length decoding and incompatibility with key-value (KV)
caches. Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed
block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence
Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling
the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the
length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building
on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can
retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost.
Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks,
but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence,
thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying
uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM
matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training
samples, while achieving 2.1 higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the
SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating
the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm. Project page and

TL;DR: SparseD是一种针对扩散语言模型的新型稀疏注意力方法，通过一次性预计算头特定的稀疏模式并在所有去噪步骤中复用，结合早期步骤使用全注意力、后期步骤切换为稀疏注意力的策略，实现了无损加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源扩散语言模型存在高推理延迟问题，主要原因是注意力机制在长上下文中的二次复杂度。虽然稀疏注意力在自回归模型中已有应用，但扩散语言模型具有不同的稀疏性行为特征，使得现有稀疏注意力方法不适用。

Method: SparseD方法：1）一次性预计算头特定的稀疏模式并在所有去噪步骤中复用；2）在早期关键去噪步骤使用全注意力，后期步骤切换为稀疏注意力；3）利用扩散语言模型中注意力模式在头间变化、在去噪步骤间保持相似、早期步骤对生成质量关键的观察。

Result: 实验结果表明，SparseD实现了无损加速，在64k上下文长度和1024个去噪步骤的情况下，相比FlashAttention实现了1.50倍的加速。

Conclusion: SparseD为在长上下文应用中部署扩散语言模型提供了一个实用且高效的解决方案，能够显著降低推理延迟而不损失生成质量。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to
autoregressive models (ARs), existing open-source DLMs suffer from high
inference latency. This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic
complexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.
Intuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict
attention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.
Such approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and
clearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity
behaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in
each head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising
steps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention
methods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to
capture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in
early denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel
sparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only
requires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them
across all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising
step. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches
to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality. Together, these
establish SparseD as a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in
long-context applications. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD
achieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to $1.50\times$ speedup over
FlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型虽然性能优越，但存在二次时间和内存复杂度的限制，难以处理长上下文。需要开发能高效建模不同长度上下文的架构。

Method: 提出ResFormer架构，采用级联方法：使用带非线性读出的储层计算网络捕获长期上下文依赖（线性时间），同时用传统Transformer处理固定长度的短期句子依赖。

Result: 在EmoryNLP数据集上准确率比DeepSeek-Qwen和ModernBERT基线模型提升高达+22.3%，在MultiWOZ、MELD和IEMOCAP数据集上也有稳定提升，同时内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: ResFormer在建模广泛上下文信息方面展现出高效性和有效性，为序列分类任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Sequence classification is essential in NLP for understanding and
categorizing language patterns in tasks like sentiment analysis, intent
detection, and topic classification. Transformer-based models, despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance, have inherent limitations due to
quadratic time and memory complexity, restricting their input length. Although
extensive efforts have aimed at reducing computational demands, processing
extensive contexts remains challenging.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose ResFormer, a novel neural network
architecture designed to model varying context lengths efficiently through a
cascaded methodology. ResFormer integrates an reservoir computing network
featuring a nonlinear readout to effectively capture long-term contextual
dependencies in linear time. Concurrently, short-term dependencies within
sentences are modeled using a conventional Transformer architecture with
fixed-length inputs.
  Experiments demonstrate that ResFormer significantly outperforms baseline
models of DeepSeek-Qwen and ModernBERT, delivering an accuracy improvement of
up to +22.3% on the EmoryNLP dataset and consistent gains on MultiWOZ, MELD,
and IEMOCAP. In addition, ResFormer exhibits reduced memory consumption,
underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in modeling extensive contextual
information.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a very important natural language processing activity
in which one identifies the polarity of a text, whether it conveys positive,
negative, or neutral sentiment. Along with the growth of social media and the
Internet, the significance of sentiment analysis has grown across numerous
industries such as marketing, politics, and customer service. Sentiment
analysis is flawed, however, when applied to foreign languages, particularly
when there is no labelled data to train models upon. In this study, we present
a transformer ensemble model and a large language model (LLM) that employs

Sentiment was then assessed for sentences using an ensemble of pre-trained

Our experimental results indicated that sentiment analysis performance was more
than 86% using the proposed method.

*Matteo Boffa,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出大规模约束生成(LSCG)问题，评估LLMs处理大量细粒度通用约束的能力，并开发Words Checker实例和FoCusNet模型来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在少量任务特定约束下的生成能力，而本文探索LLMs能否解析大规模、细粒度的通用约束列表。

Method: 创建Words Checker实例评估模型特性(大小、家族)和引导技术(简单提示、思维链、Best of N)的影响，并提出FoCusNet模型将原始约束列表解析为更小子集。

Result: 实验显示现有解决方案在约束数量增加时性能显著下降，而FoCusNet能带来8-13%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: LLMs处理大规模约束的能力有限，FoCusNet通过聚焦相关约束能有效提升性能，为大规模约束生成问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has explored the constrained generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) when explicitly prompted by few task-specific
requirements. In contrast, we introduce Large-Scale Constraint Generation
(LSCG), a new problem that evaluates whether LLMs can parse a large,
fine-grained, generic list of constraints. To examine the LLMs' ability to
handle an increasing number constraints, we create a practical instance of
LSCG, called Words Checker. In Words Checker, we evaluate the impact of model
characteristics (e.g., size, family) and steering techniques (e.g., Simple
Prompt, Chain of Thought, Best of N) on performance. We also propose FoCusNet,
a small and dedicated model that parses the original list of constraints into a
smaller subset, helping the LLM focus on relevant constraints. Experiments
reveal that existing solutions suffer a significant performance drop as the
number of constraints increases, with FoCusNet showing an 8-13% accuracy boost.

TL;DR: 提出了GEAR评估框架，用于评估大语言模型的溯因推理能力，通过一致性、泛化性和多样性三个指标自动评分，无需人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注指令遵循和演绎推理，但大语言模型能否发现新知识以及如何评估这种能力仍是核心问题。

Method: 引入GEAR评估范式，基于一致性、泛化性和多样性三个指标自动评分假设集，并提出基于动量的课程学习策略调整训练数据。

Result: 在4个溯因推理基准测试的1500个问题上评估了9个大语言模型，生成了超过5万个候选假设，揭示了传统评估方法无法发现的模型差异。

Conclusion: GEAR提供了一个原则性框架，既能评估溯因推理能力，又能提供无需标注的可扩展训练信号，帮助大语言模型生成更多样化和可靠的假设。

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), research has focused on
instruction following and deductive reasoning. A central question remains: can
these models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We
address this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible
hypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for
Abductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and
label-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics:
consistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability
(consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and
diversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way,
GEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring
aligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when
models produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate
once accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine
LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000
candidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or
purely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that
adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what
the model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating
diverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives.
Without gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and
these gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken
together, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and
supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more
diverse and reliable hypotheses.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为BTC-SAM的偏见测试框架，利用大语言模型生成高质量测试用例来检测情感分析模型中的社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感分析模型存在固有的社会偏见，这些偏见在现实应用中可能造成危害。传统方法构建多样化测试句子成本高昂，需要领域专家和众包。

Method: 使用大语言模型进行可控的测试句子生成，提供最小化规范要求，生成具有高语言变异性和多样性的测试句子。

Result: 实验显示该方法相比基础提示方法能提供更好的测试覆盖率，即使对于先前未见过的偏见也有效。

Conclusion: BTC-SAM框架能够高效生成高质量测试用例，有效检测情感分析模型中的社会偏见。

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis (SA) models harbor inherent social biases that can be
harmful in real-world applications. These biases are identified by examining
the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of
the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse
sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is
expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires
domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias
testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias
testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models
(LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show
that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the
test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base
prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于道德基础理论的语用推理方法，通过利用上下文信息来弥合语用鸿沟，显著提升大语言模型在道德推理中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在道德推理方面面临泛化挑战，因为模型擅长捕捉分布语义，而道德推理在语用层面运作，两者存在根本差异。

Method: 基于道德基础理论提出语用推理方法，在每一步利用上下文信息来弥合语用鸿沟，引导LLMs将道德基础与道德推理目标联系起来。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著增强了大语言模型在道德推理中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来基于道德基础理论的研究奠定了基础，为解决LLMs在道德推理中的泛化问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Moral reasoning has emerged as a promising research direction for Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet achieving generalization remains a central
challenge. From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs
are adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs
from the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates
how LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on
distributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in
moral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to
bridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with
moral reasoning objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning, providing a
foundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory.

Result: 在基于文本的Jericho基准测试中，GLoW为LLM方法实现了新的最先进性能。与最先进的基于RL的方法相比，在实现相当性能的同时，所需环境交互减少了100-800倍。

Conclusion: GLoW框架通过双尺度世界模型和多路径优势反射机制，有效解决了LLM智能体在硬探索任务中的挑战，显著提升了探索效率。

Abstract: LLM-based agents have seen promising advances, yet they are still limited in
"hard-exploration" tasks requiring learning new knowledge through exploration.
We present GLoW, a novel approach leveraging dual-scale world models,
maintaining a trajectory frontier of high-value discoveries at the global
scale, while learning from local trial-and-error in exploration through a
Multi-path Advantage Reflection mechanism which infers advantage-based progress
signals to guide exploration. To evaluate our framework for hard-exploration,
we tackle the Jericho benchmark suite of text-based games, where GLoW achieves
a new state-of-theart performance for LLM-based approaches. Compared to
state-of-the-art RLbased methods, our approach achieves comparable performance
while requiring 100-800x fewer environment interactions.

Abstract: As digital platforms redefine educational paradigms, ensuring interactivity
remains vital for effective learning. This paper explores using Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to automatically respond to student questions
from online lectures - a novel question answering task of real world
significance. We introduce the EduVidQA Dataset with 5252 question-answer pairs

TL;DR: 本文提出TARE框架来解决LLM提示优化的脆弱性问题，通过最小化文本锐度来确保提示在语义保持的改写下保持稳定性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注点状准确率，很少强制要求改写不变性或搜索稳定性，导致自动提示搜索仍然脆弱：小的语义保持改写经常引起大的性能波动。

Method: 提出TARE（文本锐度感知进化）框架，包含基于采样的内部对抗搜索（用困难改写测试提示）和外部鲁棒选择（偏好邻域保持强健的候选者），以及ATARE学习各向异性权重来塑造语义邻域并自适应调整半径。

Result: 在多样化任务上的评估表明，该方法设计的提示在改写下保持准确率，优于仅关注准确率的提示搜索方法，同时保持计算实用性。

Conclusion: 通过最小化文本锐度差距，TARE框架能够生成在语义改写下保持稳定性能的提示，解决了现有提示优化方法的脆弱性问题。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully
engineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging
from heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search,
primarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance
or searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in
practice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically
preserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this
brittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we
provide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete,
semantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion
over a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no
gradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual
Sharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between
an inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard
paraphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose
neighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic
weights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to
balance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose
design for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve
accuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while
remaining computationally practical.

TL;DR: 提出LOT方法，使用生成语言模型比较两个大型推理模型的推理轨迹，通过可读分类法揭示模型思考方式的系统性差异，并能提升小模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型的比较主要关注宏观统计指标，不同模型是否以不同方式推理仍是一个开放问题。

Method: LOT方法使用生成语言模型比较两个LRM的推理轨迹，用文字描述其区别特征，然后基于这些特征在LRM输出中的经验分布来预测推理轨迹的来源模型。

Result: 在数学、科学和编程任务上比较12个开源LRM，LOT识别出它们思考的系统性差异，在区分不同规模、基础模型家族或目标领域的LRM时达到80-100%准确率。

Conclusion: LOT的自然语言分类法提供了LRM思考差异的定性解释，通过将小模型推理风格与最大模型对齐，可将GPQA准确率提升3.3-5.7%。

Abstract: Current comparisons of large reasoning models (LRMs) focus on macro-level
statistics such as task accuracy or reasoning length. Whether different LRMs
reason differently remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce
the LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a
generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and
articulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these
features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical
distributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of
reasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models
think. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in
math, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their
thoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from
LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond
classification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative
explanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link
the reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of
smaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves
their accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于任务子空间对数归因(TSLA)的新框架，用于识别专门负责任务识别(TR)和任务学习(TL)的注意力头，揭示了它们在上下文学习中的不同但互补的作用机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中上下文学习(ICL)的机制基础，调和注意力头组件级分析和ICL整体分解为任务识别与任务学习两种主导视角。

Method: 提出TSLA框架识别TR和TL专用注意力头，通过相关性分析、消融实验、输入扰动以及几何分析隐藏状态的转向实验来验证。

Result: 发现TR头通过将隐藏状态与任务子空间对齐来促进任务识别，而TL头在子空间内旋转隐藏状态朝向正确标签以促进预测，两者独立且有效地捕获ICL的TR和TL组件。

Conclusion: 该框架为大型语言模型如何在不同任务和设置中执行上下文学习提供了统一且可解释的说明，能够调和先前关于ICL机制的研究发现。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of in-context learning (ICL) in
large language models by reconciling two dominant perspectives: the
component-level analysis of attention heads and the holistic decomposition of
ICL into Task Recognition (TR) and Task Learning (TL). We propose a novel
framework based on Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) to identify attention
heads specialized in TR and TL, and demonstrate their distinct yet
complementary roles. Through correlation analysis, ablation studies, and input
perturbations, we show that the identified TR and TL heads independently and
effectively capture the TR and TL components of ICL. Using steering experiments
with geometric analysis of hidden states, we reveal that TR heads promote task
recognition by aligning hidden states with the task subspace, while TL heads
rotate hidden states within the subspace toward the correct label to facilitate
prediction. We further show how previous findings on ICL mechanisms, including
induction heads and task vectors, can be reconciled with our
attention-head-level analysis of the TR-TL decomposition. Our framework thus
provides a unified and interpretable account of how large language models
execute ICL across diverse tasks and settings.

Motivation: 现有方法通常从模型输出或隐藏状态中提取任务向量，方法繁琐且不透明，很少阐明任务向量如何影响计算机制。

Method: 直接训练学习任务向量(LTVs)，并通过系统分析研究任务向量在注意力头OV电路中的机制作用。

Result: LTVs在准确性和灵活性上优于提取的任务向量，能有效作用于任意层、位置甚至ICL提示。任务向量主要通过注意力头OV电路引导预测，早期任务向量向任务相关子空间旋转，后期任务向量主要进行幅度缩放。

Conclusion: LTVs不仅提供了获取有效任务向量的实用方法，还为理解ICL的机制基础提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform new tasks from in-context
demonstrations, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent work
suggests that these demonstrations are compressed into task vectors (TVs),
compact task representations that LLMs exploit for predictions. However, prior
studies typically extract TVs from model outputs or hidden states using
cumbersome and opaque methods, and they rarely elucidate the mechanisms by
which TVs influence computation. In this work, we address both limitations.
First, we propose directly training Learned Task Vectors (LTVs), which surpass
extracted TVs in accuracy and exhibit superior flexibility-acting effectively
at arbitrary layers, positions, and even with ICL prompts. Second, through
systematic analysis, we investigate the mechanistic role of TVs, showing that
at the low level they steer predictions primarily through attention-head OV
circuits, with a small subset of "key heads" most decisive. At a higher level,
we find that despite Transformer nonlinearities, TV propagation is largely
linear: early TVs are rotated toward task-relevant subspaces to improve logits
of relevant labels, while later TVs are predominantly scaled in magnitude.
Taken together, LTVs not only provide a practical approach for obtaining
effective TVs but also offer a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations
of ICL.

Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的GUI代理在现实应用中面临训练数据稀缺和复杂任务中长尾知识覆盖不足的问题，限制了其有效性。

Method: 首先通过监督微调进行预热，然后通过自引导拒绝采样微调进一步优化。RAG-GUI采用检索增强生成技术，在推理时利用网络教程，是一个模型无关的通用插件。

Result: 在三个不同任务上的评估显示，RAG-GUI始终优于基线代理，在两个模型规模上比其他推理基线高出2.6%到13.3%，表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAG-GUI证明了在现实场景中具有强大的泛化能力和实用的即插即用能力，能够有效提升基于VLM的GUI代理性能。

Abstract: GUI agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in
automating complex digital tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world
applications is often limited by scarce training data and the inherent
complexity of these tasks, which frequently require long-tailed knowledge
covering rare, unseen scenarios. We propose RAG-GUI , a lightweight VLM that
leverages web tutorials at inference time. RAG-GUI is first warm-started via
supervised finetuning (SFT) and further refined through self-guided rejection
sampling finetuning (RSF). Designed to be model-agnostic, RAG-GUI functions as
a generic plug-in that enhances any VLM-based agent. Evaluated across three
distinct tasks, it consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other
inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes, demonstrating
strong generalization and practical plug-and-play capabilities in real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: 建立了基于心理测量学的稳健方法，为LLMs在医疗保健中的安全、有效和可信部署提供了决策支持框架。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for high-stakes
medical applications, there has emerged a critical need for reliable and
accurate evaluation methodologies. Traditional accuracy metrics fail
inadequately as they neither capture question characteristics nor offer
topic-specific insights. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{MedIRT}, a
rigorous evaluation framework grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT), the gold
standard in high-stakes educational testing. Unlike previous research relying
on archival data, we prospectively gathered fresh responses from 80 diverse
LLMs on a balanced, 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark. Using one
unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, we estimate LLM's
latent model ability jointly with question difficulty and discrimination,
yielding more stable and nuanced performance rankings than accuracy alone.
Notably, we identify distinctive ``spiky'' ability profiles, where overall
rankings can be misleading due to highly specialized model abilities. While
\texttt{GPT-5} was the top performer in a majority of domains (8 of 11), it was
outperformed in Social Science and Communication by \texttt{Claude-3-opus},
demonstrating that even an overall 23rd-ranked model can hold the top spot for
specific competencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate IRT's utility in auditing
benchmarks by identifying flawed questions. We synthesize these findings into a
practical decision-support framework that integrates our multi-factor
competency profiles with operational metrics. This work establishes a robust,
psychometrically grounded methodology essential for the safe, effective, and
trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有使用LLM直接生成用户偏好列表的方法虽然对短期预测有效，但限制了个性化能力，其不透明的决策过程阻碍了整体用户画像构建并加剧了流行度偏差。

Method: PET框架将任务重新定义为在稳定可解释的偏好簇格上推断动态概率分布，应用logit-probing和生成式分类技术来推断用户的偏好概率分布。

Result: 在公开基准测试(Yelp, MovieLens)上，PET比直接生成基线在NDCG指标上提升了40%；在短视频平台的大规模真实数据集上，在长尾内容排序方面表现出色，NDCG分数比SOTA生产模型高出7倍。

Conclusion: PET将用户画像模型从直接偏好列表生成转变为透明的分布偏好映射，为更可解释、公平和多样化的个性化系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding how user preference evolves over time is a fundamental
challenge central to modern digital ecosystems, for which Large Language Models
(LLMs) are an increasingly prominent and popular approach due to their ability
to comprehend the rich semantic context within behavioral data. A common
practice is to use LLMs to predict a user's next action by directly generating
a ranked list of preferred items. Although effective for short-term prediction,
the end-to-end generation paradigm inherently limits personalization. Its
opaque decision-making process obscures holistic user profiling and exacerbates
popularity bias. To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution
Tracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic
probability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference
clusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques,
PET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling
transparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET
improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines.
On a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at
ranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model
by 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model
from direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional
preference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse
personalization systems.

Abstract: Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to
ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability. We propose

generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of
search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning
optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate
annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10
datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on
document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance
of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller
scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented
LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and
effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks. Our code will be published

### [120] [Can Large Language Models Express Uncertainty Like Human?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24202)
*Linwei Tao,Yi-Fan Yeh,Bo Kai,Minjing Dong,Tao Huang,Tom A. Lamb,Jialin Yu,Philip H. S. Torr,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出语言置信度作为LLM不确定性估计的轻量级、人类对齐方法，通过构建首个大规模对冲表达数据集和轻量级映射器，系统研究了现代LLM的语言置信度表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM应用于高风险场景时，过度自信的响应会误导用户。现有置信度估计方法存在实际障碍：logits通常隐藏、多采样计算成本高、数值化不确定性表达偏离自然交流。

Method: 1) 发布首个多样化、大规模的对冲表达数据集；2) 提出轻量级映射器将对冲表达转换为置信度分数；3) 系统研究现代LLM的语言置信度表现；4) 引入微调框架提升语言置信度可靠性。

Result: 研究发现大多数LLM在表达可靠语言置信度方面表现不佳，但精心设计的提示方法能达到竞争性的校准和区分能力，微调框架可进一步提升可靠性。

Conclusion: 语言置信度是LLM不确定性估计的可扩展、高效且人类对齐的方法，值得进一步探索这一有前景但研究不足的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where overconfident responses can mislead users. Reliable confidence estimation
has been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face
practical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally
expensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score)
deviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC),
where models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably,
might), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this
direction, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging
expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a
lightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero
cost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of
LC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs
underperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves
competitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a
fine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability. Taken together, our
work positions linguistic confidence as a scalable, efficient, and
human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation, and calls for deeper
exploration of this promising yet underexplored direction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BeyondBench是一个通过算法问题生成来避免训练数据污染的语言模型评估框架，包含44个算法任务和117个变体，分为三个难度级别，评估了101个语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于静态基准测试在互联网上存在训练数据污染风险，无法确定模型是真正推理还是仅仅回忆答案，因此需要开发不受污染的评估框架。

Method: 使用算法问题生成方法，在运行时创建基于数学的问题，确保每个测试都是新鲜且未被污染的。框架包含44个算法任务，分为简单、中等和困难三个套件，每个任务从超过10^15个独特实例的组合空间中生成问题。

Result: 评估了101个语言模型（85个开源和16个闭源），结果显示所有模型家族都存在一致的推理缺陷，随着问题复杂度从多项式增加到指数级，性能急剧下降。在困难套件中，Gemini-2.5-pro、Llama-3.3-70B和Qwen2.5-72B的平均准确率分别为56.38%、26.91%和33.60%。

Conclusion: BeyondBench提供了一个可靠的评估框架来测试语言模型的真实推理能力，揭示了当前模型在复杂推理任务上的显著局限性，特别是在不使用工具的情况下性能大幅下降。

Abstract: Evaluating language models fairly is becoming harder as static benchmarks
available on the internet risk contamination by training data. This makes it
unclear whether models are truly reasoning or just recalling answers. In this
paper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this
problem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks
that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates
mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh
and uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of
117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks)
for basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations)
for sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68
variations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each
task generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique
instances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We
evaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source
models, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization
schemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model
families, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases
from polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as
Gemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of
56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance
drops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano
showing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite. Our
leaderboard is publicly available at https://ctrl-gaurav.github.io/BeyondBench/

*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScenarioBench是一个用于评估文本到SQL和检索增强生成在合规场景中的基准测试，包含决策准确性、追踪质量、检索效果等多维度评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到SQL或KILT/RAG基准测试缺乏将决策与条款级证据严格关联的机制，无法评估系统在合规场景下的解释质量。

Method: 通过YAML场景设计，包含不可见的黄金标准包、最小见证追踪、管辖条款集和规范SQL，要求系统使用相同政策规范中的条款ID来证明输出。

Result: 评估器报告决策准确性、追踪质量、检索效果、SQL正确性、政策覆盖率、延迟和解释幻觉率等指标，并引入标准化场景难度指数。

Conclusion: ScenarioBench在严格基础和不可见规则下将每个决策与条款级证据关联，在明确时间预算下将收益转向解释质量评估。

Abstract: ScenarioBench is a policy-grounded, trace-aware benchmark for evaluating
Text-to-SQL and retrieval-augmented generation in compliance contexts. Each
YAML scenario includes a no-peek gold-standard package with the expected
decision, a minimal witness trace, the governing clause set, and the canonical
SQL, enabling end-to-end scoring of both what a system decides and why. Systems
must justify outputs using clause IDs from the same policy canon, making
explanations falsifiable and audit-ready. The evaluator reports decision
accuracy, trace quality (completeness, correctness, order), retrieval
effectiveness, SQL correctness via result-set equivalence, policy coverage,
latency, and an explanation-hallucination rate. A normalized Scenario
Difficulty Index (SDI) and a budgeted variant (SDI-R) aggregate results while
accounting for retrieval difficulty and time. Compared with prior Text-to-SQL
or KILT/RAG benchmarks, ScenarioBench ties each decision to clause-level
evidence under strict grounding and no-peek rules, shifting gains toward
justification quality under explicit time budgets.

Motivation: 研究人员在分析人类道德价值观时面临理论框架多样性和数据可用性的挑战，需要通用化的分类工具来促进沟通研究。

Method: 开发了包含16个标注数据集的资源套件，采用轻量级LLM提示策略，提出all@once分类方法（类似于多标签分类器链）。

Result: MoVa的提示策略在多个领域和框架中优于微调模型，能够促进对人类和机器沟通的细粒度解释。

Conclusion: MoVa资源套件为道德价值观分类提供了有效工具，对机器行为对齐具有潜在影响。

Abstract: Identifying human morals and values embedded in language is essential to
empirical studies of communication. However, researchers often face substantial
difficulty navigating the diversity of theoretical frameworks and data
available for their analysis. Here, we contribute MoVa, a well-documented suite
of resources for generalizable classification of human morals and values,
consisting of (1) 16 labeled datasets and benchmarking results from four
theoretically-grounded frameworks; (2) a lightweight LLM prompting strategy
that outperforms fine-tuned models across multiple domains and frameworks; and
(3) a new application that helps evaluate psychological surveys. In practice,
we specifically recommend a classification strategy, all@once, that scores all
related concepts simultaneously, resembling the well-known multi-label
classifier chain. The data and methods in MoVa can facilitate many fine-grained
interpretations of human and machine communication, with potential implications
for the alignment of machine behavior.

Method: 基于竞赛组织者提供的数据集合成数据，采用Qwen3-14B模型进行LoRA微调和模型融合，使用三个不同的LoRA适配器分别处理工具调用、带工具调用结果的响应生成和不带工具调用结果的响应生成，通过vLLM实现多LoRA推理。

Result: 在GPU赛道中，Task 1和Task 3获得第一名，Task 2获得第二名。

Conclusion: 该方法在CPDC 2025挑战赛中表现优异，证明了多LoRA适配器结合模型融合技术在构建游戏对话AI中的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents the opdainlp team's solution for the GPU track of the
CPDC 2025 challenge. The challenge consists of three tasks, aiming to build an
in-game conversational AI that adheres to character personas, aligns with the
game's worldview, and supports function calling. Considering both effectiveness
and resource/time constraints during inference, we synthesized data for some of
the tasks based on the datasets provided by the competition organizers. We
employed Qwen3-14B with LoRA fine-tuning and model fusion, and utilized a base
model integrated with multiple LoRA adapters during inference. Specifically, in
the competition, we used three distinct LoRA adapters to handle tool calling,
response generation with tool call results, and response generation without
tool call results, respectively. MultiLoRA inference was implemented using
vLLM. Our solution achieved the first place in Task 1 and Task 3, and the
second place in Task 2 of the GPU track.

TL;DR: MetaTuner是一个联合集成提示优化和微调的新框架，通过共享编码层实现知识共享，在多样化基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示优化和微调是提升大语言模型性能的两种主要方法，但之前的研究通常将它们孤立研究，未能充分探索它们的协同潜力。

Method: 引入两个神经网络分别生成提示和参数，让它们共享共同的底层编码层以实现知识共享，并设计监督正则化损失来有效训练框架。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 联合集成提示优化和微调能够有效提升大语言模型的性能，MetaTuner框架展示了这种协同方法的潜力。

Abstract: Prompt optimization and fine-tuning are two major approaches to improve the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). They enhance the capabilities of
LLMs from complementary perspectives: the former through explicit natural
language, and the latter through implicit parameter updates. However, prior
work has typically studied them in isolation, leaving their synergistic
potential largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we
introduce MetaTuner, a novel framework that jointly integrates prompt
optimization and fine-tuning for LLM training. Specifically, we introduce two
neural networks to generate prompts and parameters, respectively, while
allowing them to share a common bottom encoding layer to enable knowledge
sharing. By the guidance of the final supervised signals, our framework is
optimized to discover the optimal combinations between the prompts and
parameters. Given that prompt learning involves discrete optimization while
fine-tuning operates in a continuous parameter space, we design a supervised
regularization loss to train our framework effectively. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms the
baselines.

TL;DR: SimuHome是一个基于Matter协议的智能家居模拟环境，用于评估LLM代理在复杂智能家居任务中的表现，包括潜在用户意图理解、时间依赖性和设备约束等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发智能家居代理面临缺乏真实模拟环境和评估基准的瓶颈，需要解决潜在用户意图、时间依赖、设备约束等独特挑战。

Method: 构建基于Matter协议的SimuHome模拟环境，支持时间加速、设备模拟和API调用，创建包含600个场景的基准测试，评估11种代理在ReAct框架下的表现。

Result: 代理在简单任务上表现良好，但在潜在意图推断、状态验证和时间调度方面表现不佳，最佳模型GPT-4.1成功率仅为54%。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够可靠验证当前状态并通过工具协调时间相关动作的方法，以提高智能家居代理的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks.
However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle
latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and
more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such
capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where
agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a
challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart
devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables.
By building the simulator on the Matter protocol (the global industry standard
for smart home communication), SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment,
and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant
devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600
episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned
capabilities. Our evaluation of 11 agents under a unified ReAct framework
reveals that while models perform well on simple tasks, they struggle with
latent intent inference, state verification, and especially temporal
scheduling. Even the top-performing model, GPT-4.1, reaches only 54% success
rate. These findings highlight a critical need for methods that can reliably
verify the current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent
actions.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的嵌入方法通常采用编码器范式，将LLM视为静态特征提取器，忽视了其核心的生成能力。

Method: 提出GIRCSE框架，利用自回归生成迭代优化语义表示，通过迭代对比优化目标指导生成过程，产生软标记序列来捕捉潜在概念和隐式语义。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试和指令跟随任务中优于现有LLM嵌入基线，展现出推理时扩展特性：生成更多标记可稳步提升嵌入质量。

Conclusion: 生成式迭代优化为表示学习建立了新范式，证明了利用LLM生成能力进行语义表示学习的有效性。

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM)-based embeddings typically adopt an
encoder-only paradigm, treating LLMs as static feature extractors and
overlooking their core generative strengths. We introduce GIRCSE (Generative
Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework
that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic
representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under
contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics
that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an
Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each
refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show
that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB
benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an
emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference
steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative
refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.

Abstract: Grounded theory offers deep insights from qualitative data, but its reliance

Current computational tools stop short of true automation, keeping researchers
firmly in the loop. We introduce LOGOS, a novel, end-to-end framework that
fully automates the grounded theory workflow, transforming raw text into a
structured, hierarchical theory. LOGOS integrates LLM-driven coding, semantic
clustering, graph reasoning, and a novel iterative refinement process to build
highly reusable codebooks. To ensure fair comparison, we also introduce a
principled 5-dimensional metric and a train-test split protocol for
standardized, unbiased evaluation. Across five diverse corpora, LOGOS
consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves a remarkable $88.2\%$
alignment with an expert-developed schema on a complex dataset. LOGOS
demonstrates a powerful new path to democratize and scale qualitative research

Motivation: 扩散大语言模型的迭代和并行生成机制带来了与自回归LLMs根本不同的安全漏洞，需要深入分析其脆弱性并开发有效的防御方法。

Method: 从两个维度分析dLLM漏洞：步内动态和步间动态。提出DiffuGuard防御框架，包含随机退火重掩码（动态引入受控随机性）和块级审计修复（利用内部表示进行风险检测和引导修正）。

Result: 实验显示DiffuGuard在四个dLLM上表现优异，将六种不同越狱方法的攻击成功率从47.9%降至14.7%，同时保持了模型效用和效率。

Conclusion: 当前解码策略构成显著漏洞，但dLLMs具有巨大的内在安全潜力；DiffuGuard通过训练免费的双阶段方法有效解锁了这种潜力，为dLLM安全提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduces
unprecedented vulnerabilities that are fundamentally distinct from
Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation
mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM
vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step
and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in
the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we
term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens
decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while
current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs
possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we
propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses
vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking
dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias,
while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for
autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on
four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack
Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while
preserving model utility and efficiency. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 高质量多模态基准测试对于推进大型模型的科学推理能力至关重要，但手动创建成本高昂且难以扩展。为了解决这一瓶颈，需要探索将纯文本问答对转化为高质量多模态问答对的方法。

Method: 开发了TQA-to-MMQA框架，建立了多维度MMQA质量评估标准；构建了两个基准测试；开发了Q-Mirror智能体系统，将MMQA生成和评估整合到闭环迭代优化中。

Result: 实验表明，虽然最先进的模型能够生成MMQA，但输出质量仍有显著差距；顶级理解模型在MMQA质量评估中与人类判断高度一致；Q-Mirror智能体将平均分数从78.90提升到85.22，通过率从72%提升到95%。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模科学基准测试提供了一条实用路径，通过智能体系统实现了MMQA的自动生成和质量提升。

Abstract: High-quality, multi-modal benchmarks are crucial for advancing scientific
reasoning in large models yet their manual creation is costly and unscalable.
To address this bottleneck, we explore the potential for transforming Text-Only
QA Pairs (TQAs) into high-quality Multi-Modal QA Pairs (MMQAs), which include
three parts: 1) Task Definition \& Evaluation Rubric: We develop a TQA-to-MMQA
framework and establish a comprehensive, multi-dimensional MMQA quality rubric
that provides principles for the transformation. 2) Benchmark Construction:
Then we construct two extensive benchmarks to rigorously evaluate
state-of-the-art generation \& understanding models on the distinct tasks of
MMQA generation \& MMQA quality evaluation. 3) Preliminary Solution: We develop
an agentic system (Q-Mirror), which operationalizes our framework by
integrating MMQA generation and evaluation into a closed loop for iterative
refinement. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art models can
generate MMQAs, their outputs still leave substantial gaps, underscoring the
need for reliable evaluation. We further demonstrate that top-tier
understanding models align closely with human judgment in MMQA quality
assessment. Leveraging both insights, the Q-Mirror agent raises average scores
from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72\% to 95\%, offering a practical path
to large-scale scientific benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs价值观表达的底层机制，特别是内在表达和提示表达是否共享相同机制，这对价值观对齐和角色引导应用至关重要。

Method: 使用两种方法进行机制分析：(1) 从残差流中提取代表价值观机制的特征方向（价值观向量），(2) 识别对价值观表达有贡献的MLP神经元（价值观神经元）。

Result: 发现内在和提示价值观机制部分共享诱导价值观表达的关键组件，但也各有独特元素，导致不同的可操控性（提示>内在）和响应多样性（内在>提示）。

Conclusion: 内在机制独特组件促进词汇多样性，提示机制独特组件主要强化指令遵循，甚至在越狱等远程任务中也发挥作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct
ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned
during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts.
Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is
paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly
whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially
different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at
the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature
directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream,
and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We
demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common
components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess
unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms
lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and
response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to
the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas
those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction
following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances in
language understanding, marking a significant step toward artificial general
intelligence (AGI). With increasing demands for higher-level semantics and
cross-modal fusion, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged,
integrating diverse information sources (e.g., text, vision, and audio) to
enhance modeling and reasoning in complex scenarios. In AI for Science,
multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning has become a rapidly growing
frontier. While LLMs and MLLMs have achieved notable progress in this area, the
field still lacks a systematic review that consolidates recent developments. To
address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs
for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets,
and performance benchmarks. We further highlight key challenges and outline
future research directions, aiming to offer researchers both an authoritative
reference and practical insights for advancing this domain. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to comprehensively survey the
intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning. The

### [134] [Speculative Verification: Exploiting Information Gain to Refine Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24328)
*Sungkyun Kim,Jaemin Kim,Dogyung Yoon,Jiho Shin,Junyeol Lee,Jiwon Seo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Speculative Verification (SV)方法，通过动态预测推测精度和调整验证长度来优化推测解码，提高大语言模型的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码在推测精度低时，拒绝令牌的开销会抵消其优势，特别是在大批量场景下效率受限。

Method: 引入一个与草稿模型大小相似的辅助模型来估计草稿模型与目标模型分布的对齐程度，动态调整验证长度以减少计算浪费。

Result: 在9种模型组合和批量大小4-80的实验中都优于传统推测解码和目标模型标准解码，大批量设置下平均加速1.4倍，最高提升2倍。

Conclusion: SV方法具有鲁棒性、可扩展性和实用性，无需修改现有模型即可显著提升LLM推理效率。

Abstract: LLMs have low GPU efficiency and high latency due to autoregressive decoding.
Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this using a small draft model to
speculatively generate multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by
a target model. However, when speculation accuracy is low, the overhead from
rejected tokens can offset the benefits, limiting SD's effectiveness,
especially at large batch sizes. To address this, we propose Speculative
Verification (SV), an efficient augmentation to SD that dynamically predicts
speculation accuracy and adapts the verification length to maximize throughput.
SV introduces a companion model - a small auxiliary model similar in size to
the draft model - to estimate the alignment between draft and target model
distributions. By maximizing the information gain from quantifying this
alignment, SV refines verification decisions, reducing wasted computation on
rejected tokens and improving decoding efficiency. Moreover, SV requires no
modifications to the draft or target models and is compatible with existing SD
variants. We extensively evaluated SV on publicly available LLMs across three
NLP tasks using nine combinations of draft, companion, and target models,
including 13B-72B target models and three types of variations: base (no
finetuning), instruction-tuned, and task fine-tuned. Across all experiments and
batch sizes (4-80), SV consistently outperforms both SD and standard decoding
with the target model. It improves SD performance by up to 2$\times$, with an
average speedup of 1.4 $\times$ in large-batch settings (batch sizes 32-80).
These results demonstrate SV's robustness, scalability, and practical utility
for efficient LLM inference.

*Mengyu Bu,Shaolei Zhang,Zhongjun He,Hua Wu,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AlignX是一个两阶段表示级框架，通过多语言语义对齐和指令微调来提升预训练大语言模型在多语言任务上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在非主导语言上的表现和跨语言对齐能力往往较差，现有的大规模多语言语料微调方法存在对齐不精确和知识迁移效果不佳的问题。

Method: 提出AlignX两阶段框架：第一阶段通过多语言语义对齐和语言特征整合来对齐多语言表示；第二阶段通过多语言指令微调来激发LLM的多语言能力。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法提升了LLM在多语言通用能力和跨语言生成能力上的表现，并使多语言表示更加接近，改善了跨语言对齐。

Conclusion: AlignX框架有效缩小了多语言性能差距，通过表示级对齐和指令微调显著提升了预训练LLM在多语言任务上的表现。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) possess impressive multilingual
understanding and generation capabilities. However, their performance and
cross-lingual alignment often lag for non-dominant languages. A common solution
is to fine-tune LLMs on large-scale and more balanced multilingual corpus, but
such approaches often lead to imprecise alignment and suboptimal knowledge
transfer, struggling with limited improvements across languages. In this paper,
we propose AlignX to bridge the multilingual performance gap, which is a
two-stage representation-level framework for enhancing multilingual performance
of pre-trained LLMs. In the first stage, we align multilingual representations
with multilingual semantic alignment and language feature integration. In the
second stage, we stimulate the multilingual capability of LLMs via multilingual
instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results on several pre-trained LLMs
demonstrate that our approach enhances LLMs' multilingual general and
cross-lingual generation capability. Further analysis indicates that AlignX
brings the multilingual representations closer and improves the cross-lingual
alignment.

### [136] [Beyond Repetition: Text Simplification and Curriculum Learning for Data-Constrained Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24356)
*Matthew Theodore Roque,Dan John Velasco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究在数据受限环境下，通过文本复杂度排序和简化数据增强来优化语言模型预训练，发现添加简化数据能提升性能，且不同规模模型适合不同的数据调度策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注大数据集预训练，而在数据受限环境下，训练数据顺序和包含相同文本的替代版本的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于平行语料库（原始文本与LLM简化文本对齐），测试四种数据调度策略：重复暴露、低到高复杂度、高到低复杂度、交错排列，并通过微调和零样本任务评估表示质量。

Result: 添加简化数据相比重复暴露基线能改善微调和零样本性能；较小模型从低到高复杂度排序中受益，而较大模型在交错排序下表现更好。

Conclusion: 在数据受限的预训练中，数据调度策略应根据模型规模进行选择，简化数据增强能有效提升模型表示质量。

Abstract: Most studies on language model pretraining focus on large datasets, leaving
open questions about optimization in data-constrained settings. In such
settings, the effects of training data order and of including alternative
versions of the same text remain underexplored. We address this by studying
curriculum learning in pretraining, focusing on text-complexity ordering and
data augmentation via simplification. We ask: (1) Does simplifying texts
enhance representation quality more than reusing the original data? and (2)
Does ordering data by text complexity yield better representations? To answer,
we build on a pair of parallel corpora where human-written paragraphs are
aligned with LLM-simplified variants, and test four data schedules: repeated
exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. We analyze
models' representation quality from a sample efficiency perspective via
fine-tuning, as well as its zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge,
entity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our findings show
that adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over
a repeated-exposure baseline: smaller models benefit from low-to-high
complexity, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了强化中训练(RMT)框架，作为大型语言模型开发中预训练和后训练之间的中间阶段，通过动态token预算、课程自适应采样和双训练策略解决训练效率问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型开发只有预训练和后训练两个阶段，缺乏中间优化阶段。本文指出需要强化中训练阶段来获得更强的性能提升，解决推理步骤过多、token熵分布不平衡和token信息利用不足三个关键挑战。

Method: 提出RMT框架：1) 动态token预算机制约束不必要推理步骤；2) 课程自适应采样方法实现从易到难的渐进学习；3) 结合强化学习和下一token预测的双训练策略，充分利用所有token信息。

Result: 实验显示RMT相比现有方法性能提升高达+64.91%，推理长度仅需21%。强化中训练获得的检查点对后续后训练也有益，在数学领域提升达+18.76%。

Conclusion: 强化中训练是大型语言模型开发中一个有效且必要的中间阶段，RMT框架通过高效、自适应和统一的训练方法显著提升模型性能，并为后续训练提供更好的起点。

Abstract: The development of state-of-the-art large language models is commonly
understood as a two-stage process involving pre-training and post-training. We
point out the need for an additional intermediate stage called reinforcement
mid-training with potential for strong performance gains. In this paper, we
formally define the problem and identify three key challenges: (1) inefficient
training due to excessive reasoning steps, (2) disregard of the imbalanced
token entropy distribution, and (3) underutilization of token information. To
address these challenges, we propose RMT, a framework for efficient, adaptive,
and unified reinforcement mid-training with various innovative components. In
particular, we first introduce a dynamic token budget mechanism that constrains
unnecessary reasoning steps and mitigates model overthinking. Next, we design a
curriculum-based adaptive sampling method that fosters a progressive learning
trajectory from easy to hard tokens. Finally, we present a dual training
strategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction,
ensuring targeted learning on key tokens and full exploitation of all token
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMT over
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +64.91% performance improvement with
only 21% of the reasoning length in language modeling. We also show that
checkpoints obtained after reinforcement mid-training can benefit the
subsequent post-training, yielding up to +18.76% improvement in the
mathematical domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HarmMetric Eval基准，用于评估大语言模型有害性度量和评判器的质量，发现传统指标METEOR和ROUGE-1在评估模型响应有害性方面优于基于LLM的评判器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统性基准来评估各种有害性度量和评判器的质量与有效性，这影响了报告越狱攻击有效性和其他风险的可信度。

Method: 构建包含代表性有害提示与多样化有害/无害模型响应的高质量数据集，设计灵活的评分机制，支持整体和细粒度评估。

Result: 实验发现传统指标METEOR和ROUGE-1在评估模型响应有害性方面优于基于LLM的评判器，挑战了LLM在此领域优越性的普遍认知。

Conclusion: HarmMetric Eval基准为评估有害性度量和评判器提供了可靠工具，揭示了传统指标在特定任务中的优势，对LLM安全部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to
elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak
attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the
harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark
to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines
the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To
address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness
metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of
representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful
model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various
metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a
surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform
LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging
prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is
publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在掩码扩散语言模型中集成稀疏MoE架构，在保持高效推理的同时发挥MoE优势，为扩散语言模型开辟新的研究方向。

Method: 采用混合专家架构，从零开始在约20T token上训练，保持7B参数容量但推理时仅激活1.4B参数，并进行指令调优。

Result: 在多个基准测试中超越之前的扩散语言模型，LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct在知识理解、代码生成、数学推理等任务上表现与Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct相当。

Conclusion: 稀疏MoE架构成功整合到扩散语言模型中，在保持高效推理的同时发挥MoE优势，为扩散语言模型研究提供了新的探索空间。

Abstract: We introduce LLaDA-MoE, a large language diffusion model with the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, trained from scratch on approximately
20T tokens. LLaDA-MoE achieves competitive performance with significantly
reduced computational overhead by maintaining a 7B-parameter capacity while
activating only 1.4B parameters during inference. Our empirical evaluation
reveals that LLaDA-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion
language models with larger parameters, surpassing previous diffusion language
models LLaDA, LLaDA 1.5, and Dream across multiple benchmarks. The
instruct-tuned model LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct demonstrates capabilities
comparable to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct in knowledge understanding, code generation,
mathematical reasoning, agent and alignment tasks, despite using fewer active
parameters. Our results show that integrating a sparse MoE architecture into
the training objective of masked diffusion language models still brings out
MoE's strengths under efficient inference with few active parameters, and opens
ample room for further exploration of diffusion language models. LLaDA-MoE
models are available at Huggingface.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的Text-to-SQL方法在BIRD等挑战性基准测试中仍显著落后于人类专家，现有测试时扩展方法缺乏协调策略且忽视了模型的内部推理过程。

Method: 采用协调测试时扩展策略，结合三个不同视角：i)通过强化学习增强的内在推理进行内部扩展，ii)通过迭代精化进行顺序扩展，iii)使用多样化合成和锦标赛选择进行并行扩展。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中达到81.67%的执行准确率，在官方排行榜上排名第一。

Conclusion: Agentar-Scale-SQL展示了一条通向人类水平性能的有效路径，是一个易于适应新数据库和更强大语言模型的通用框架。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Text-to-SQL methods still lag significantly behind
human experts on challenging benchmarks like BIRD. Current approaches that
explore test-time scaling lack an orchestrated strategy and neglect the model's
internal reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce Agentar-Scale-SQL,
a novel framework leveraging scalable computation to improve performance.
Agentar-Scale-SQL implements an Orchestrated Test-Time Scaling strategy that
synergistically combines three distinct perspectives: i) Internal Scaling via
RL-enhanced Intrinsic Reasoning, ii) Sequential Scaling through Iterative
Refinement, and iii) Parallel Scaling using Diverse Synthesis and Tournament
Selection. Agentar-Scale-SQL is a general-purpose framework designed for easy
adaptation to new databases and more powerful language models. Extensive
experiments show that Agentar-Scale-SQL achieves SOTA performance on the BIRD
benchmark, reaching 81.67\% execution accuracy on the test set and ranking
first on the official leaderboard, demonstrating an effective path toward
human-level performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数Text-to-SQL基准测试仅限于英语，限制了多语言进展，需要创建能评估跨语言SQL生成能力的基准。

Method: 扩展Spider 2.0到8种语言（英、德、法、西、葡、日、中、越），保持结构复杂性同时增加语言和方言变异性。

Result: 最先进的LLMs（如DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI o1）仅达到4%的执行准确率，而协作式语言代理方法可将准确率提升至15%。

Conclusion: 存在显著的多语言性能差距，需要开发跨语言鲁棒的方法以支持实际企业部署。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables natural access to databases, yet most benchmarks are
English-only, limiting multilingual progress. We introduce MultiSpider 2.0,
extending Spider 2.0 to eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese). It preserves Spider 2.0's
structural difficulty while adding linguistic and dialectal variability,
demanding deeper reasoning for complex SQL. On this benchmark, state-of-the-art
LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1) reach only 4\% execution accuracy when
relying on intrinsic reasoning, versus 60\% on MultiSpider 1.0. Therefore, we
provide a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively
refines queries, improving accuracy to 15\%. These results reveal a substantial
multilingual gap and motivate methods that are robust across languages and
ready for real-world enterprise deployment. Our benchmark is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往关注孤立能力，缺乏评估大语言模型能力的整体框架。需要超越任务特定基准的全面评估方法。

Method: 提出认知-领域-任务(CDT)框架，结合Cattell-Horn-Carroll认知理论细化模型能力分类，应用于数据集能力评估和数据选择。

Result: 能力指标与下游性能相关性良好，支持有效的数据集分析和构建。数据选择实验在通用和特定基准上分别获得44.3和45.4分，比基线提高1.6和2.2分。

Conclusion: CDT框架在评估大语言模型能力和支持数据选择方面具有有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
their capabilities, highlighting the need for comprehensive evaluation
frameworks that extend beyond task-specific benchmarks. However, existing
benchmarks often focus on isolated abilities, lacking a holistic framework for
assessing LLM capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the
Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT) framework, which comprehensively measures a model's
capabilities across three dimensions. We expand the scope of model capability
definitions at the cognitive level by incorporating the Cattell-Horn-Carroll
cognitive theory, refining the categorization of model capabilities. We apply
CDT in two directions: dataset capability evaluation and data selection.
Experiments show that our capability metrics correlate well with downstream
performance and can support effective dataset analysis and construction. The
experiments on data selection also show significant improvements in both
general and specific benchmarks, achieving scores of 44.3 and 45.4, with an
increase of 1.6 and 2.2 points over the baselines, respectively. These results
validate the effectiveness and practicality of CDT. Source code and models are

TL;DR: 本文综述了替代Next Token Prediction(NTP)的新兴方法生态系统，将方法分为五大类：多令牌预测、计划生成、潜在推理、连续生成方法和非Transformer架构，旨在克服NTP在长期规划、错误累积和计算效率方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NTP范式虽然推动了LLM的巨大成功，但也导致了长期规划能力差、错误累积和计算效率低等持久弱点。随着对NTP替代方案的研究兴趣日益增长，需要系统性地总结这些新兴方法。

Method: 通过分类法将替代NTP的方法分为五类：1)多令牌预测-预测未来令牌块；2)计划生成-先制定高层计划指导解码；3)潜在推理-在连续潜在空间进行自回归；4)连续生成方法-通过扩散、流匹配或能量方法进行迭代并行精炼；5)非Transformer架构-通过固有模型结构绕过NTP。

Result: 建立了替代NTP方法的分类框架，为研究提供了系统性的指导，帮助理解如何克服令牌级生成的已知限制。

Conclusion: 该综述为开发解决令牌级生成局限性的新型变革性NLP模型提供了分类学指导，推动了超越NTP范式的研究方向。

Abstract: The paradigm of Next Token Prediction (NTP) has driven the unprecedented
success of Large Language Models (LLMs), but is also the source of their most
persistent weaknesses such as poor long-term planning, error accumulation, and
computational inefficiency. Acknowledging the growing interest in exploring
alternatives to NTP, the survey describes the emerging ecosystem of
alternatives to NTP. We categorise these approaches into five main families:
(1) Multi-Token Prediction, which targets a block of future tokens instead of a
single one; (2) Plan-then-Generate, where a global, high-level plan is created
upfront to guide token-level decoding; (3) Latent Reasoning, which shifts the
autoregressive process itself into a continuous latent space; (4) Continuous
Generation Approaches, which replace sequential generation with iterative,
parallel refinement through diffusion, flow matching, or energy-based methods;
and (5) Non-Transformer Architectures, which sidestep NTP through their
inherent model structure. By synthesizing insights across these methods, this
survey offers a taxonomy to guide research into models that address the known
limitations of token-level generation to develop new transformative models for
natural language processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法主要评估对通用语言理解的影响，但文化常识与社会偏见密切相关，去偏方法对文化常识的影响尚未得到充分研究

Method: 提出SOBACO基准测试，以统一格式评估日语LLMs的社会偏见和文化常识，并评估多个LLMs在去偏前后的表现

Result: 去偏方法显著降低了LLMs在文化常识任务上的性能，准确率下降高达75%

Conclusion: 开发去偏方法时需要权衡文化常识，以提升LLMs的公平性和实用性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases, prompting the development
of various debiasing methods. However, debiasing methods may degrade the
capabilities of LLMs. Previous research has evaluated the impact of bias
mitigation primarily through tasks measuring general language understanding,
which are often unrelated to social biases. In contrast, cultural commonsense
is closely related to social biases, as both are rooted in social norms and
values. The impact of bias mitigation on cultural commonsense in LLMs has not
been well investigated. Considering this gap, we propose SOBACO (SOcial BiAs
and Cultural cOmmonsense benchmark), a Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate
social biases and cultural commonsense in LLMs in a unified format. We evaluate
several LLMs on SOBACO to examine how debiasing methods affect cultural
commonsense in LLMs. Our results reveal that the debiasing methods degrade the
performance of the LLMs on the cultural commonsense task (up to 75% accuracy
deterioration). These results highlight the importance of developing debiasing
methods that consider the trade-off with cultural commonsense to improve
fairness and utility of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合动态规划和波束搜索的新对齐算法，用于更精确地分析语音识别中的错误，特别是罕见词和领域特定词汇的错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音识别评估指标如词错误率(WER)主要反映高频词的性能，而罕见词、命名实体和领域特定词汇的错误更具语义重要性但被聚合指标掩盖，需要更精细的错误分析。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的对齐算法，将动态规划与波束搜索评分相结合，相比传统文本对齐方法能更准确地定位个体错误。

Result: 该方法提供了更准确的个体错误对齐，支持可靠的错误分析，算法已通过PyPI发布。

Conclusion: 该对齐算法能够揭示语音识别系统中被聚合指标掩盖的重要错误模式，为模型改进提供更精细的洞察。

Abstract: Modern neural networks have greatly improved performance across speech
recognition benchmarks. However, gains are often driven by frequent words with
limited semantic weight, which can obscure meaningful differences in word error
rate, the primary evaluation metric. Errors in rare terms, named entities, and
domain-specific vocabulary are more consequential, but remain hidden by
aggregate metrics. This highlights the need for finer-grained error analysis,
which depends on accurate alignment between reference and model transcripts.
However, conventional alignment methods are not designed for such precision. We
propose a novel alignment algorithm that couples dynamic programming with beam
search scoring. Compared to traditional text alignment methods, our approach
provides more accurate alignment of individual errors, enabling reliable error
analysis. The algorithm is made available via PyPI.

Motivation: 现有LLM安全缓解策略主要基于后处理过滤，存在延迟高、计算开销大、不兼容流式生成等问题，且隐私泄露内容在以往研究中关注不足。

Method: 采用轻量级自我监控模块通过表示工程在token级别持续检查高层意图，自我修复模块进行原位有害内容修正，无需单独审查对话。

Conclusion: Self-Sanitize为更安全的LLM部署提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案，支持实时流式监控和无缝修复。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide
range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding
the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite
significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards,
adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses.
Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering,
which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is
incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce
Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive
psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during
conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that
continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level
via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place
correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues.
This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with
negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that
privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous
studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy
leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior
mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility
of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

*Hongcheng Wang,Yinuo Huang,Sukai Wang,Guanghui Ren,Hao Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRPO-MA通过每个思维过程生成多个答案来解决GRPO算法中的梯度耦合、稀疏奖励和不稳定优势估计问题，显著提升模型性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析GRPO算法在训练思维链推理时面临的三个挑战：思维与答案间的梯度耦合、有限并行采样导致的稀疏奖励信号、以及不稳定的优势估计。

Method: 提出GRPO-MA方法，通过每个思维过程生成多个答案，利用多答案生成实现更稳健和高效的优化。理论上证明思维优势的方差随每个思维的答案数量增加而减小。

Result: 梯度分析证实GRPO-MA减少了梯度尖峰，在数学、代码和多样化多模态任务上的实验表明GRPO-MA显著提升了性能和训练效率。消融研究显示增加每个思维的答案数量持续增强模型性能。

Conclusion: GRPO-MA通过多答案生成有效缓解了GRPO的挑战，提供了更稳定和高效的思维链推理训练方法。

Abstract: Recent progress, such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that the GRPO algorithm, a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, can effectively train Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling
between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel
sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we
propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages
multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and
efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought
advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases.
Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA
reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and
diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves
performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that
increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SUIT是一种知识编辑方法，通过识别和修改与编辑相关的关键特征子空间，显著减少对模型的扰动，在保持高编辑效果的同时大幅提升知识保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的定位-编辑方法在修改MLP层时对关键向量和值向量没有约束，导致对编辑模型产生显著扰动，需要一种更精确的编辑方法。

Method: 提出SUIT方法，识别并仅修改与编辑相关的关键特征子空间，而不是整个向量空间。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B、GPT-J-6B和Qwen2.5-7B模型上的实验表明，SUIT在保持高编辑效果的同时显著提升了知识保留能力。

Conclusion: SUIT成功识别了编辑所需的关键子空间，为知识编辑提供了更精确有效的方法。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently correct factual errors in Language
Models (LMs). The popular locate-then-edit approach modifies an MLP layer by
finding an optimal mapping between its input vector (key) and output vector
(value) that leads to the expression of the edited knowledge. However, existing
methods without any constraints on the key and value vectors cause significant
perturbations to the edited model. To address this, we propose Subspace
Knowledge Edit (SUIT), a method that identifies and modifies only the subspace
of critical features relevant to the edit. Our empirical results on LLaMA-3-8B,
GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B models show that SUIT dramatically improves knowledge
preservation over strong baselines while maintaining high edit efficacy. This
effectiveness confirms that SUIT successfully identifies the critical subspace
for the edit. Further analyses provide additional validation for our approach.
The source code and data will be released to the public upon publication of the
paper.

TL;DR: 提出了Samiksha社区驱动评估框架，通过与民间组织和社区成员共同创建，实现文化感知的LLM评估，特别针对印度医疗领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估基准缺乏对终端用户现实生活的关注，特别是在医疗等关键领域需要反映社区日常需求、文化实践和细微背景。

Method: 与民间组织和社区成员共同创建社区驱动评估流程，通过社区反馈确定评估内容、构建基准和评分标准，实现可扩展的自动化基准测试。

Result: 展示了当前多语言LLM处理社区健康查询的能力，同时提供了情境基础性和包容性LLM评估的可扩展路径。

Conclusion: Samiksha框架为LLM评估提供了文化感知和社区驱动的方法，能够更好地反映真实用户需求，特别是在医疗等关键领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated through general or
domain-specific benchmarks testing capabilities that often lack grounding in
the lived realities of end users. Critical domains such as healthcare require
evaluations that extend beyond artificial or simulated tasks to reflect the
everyday needs, cultural practices, and nuanced contexts of communities. We
propose Samiksha, a community-driven evaluation pipeline co-created with
civil-society organizations (CSOs) and community members. Our approach enables
scalable, automated benchmarking through a culturally aware, community-driven
pipeline in which community feedback informs what to evaluate, how the
benchmark is built, and how outputs are scored. We demonstrate this approach in
the health domain in India. Our analysis highlights how current multilingual
LLMs address nuanced community health queries, while also offering a scalable
pathway for contextually grounded and inclusive LLM evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaThink-Med是一个端到端框架，通过不确定性引导的长度校准来增强医疗大语言模型的自适应思维能力，在保持性能的同时显著减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型在处理问题时无论难度如何都采用冗长的推理过程，导致实际应用中推理成本增加。需要让模型能够根据问题难度自适应地调整推理深度。

Method: 首先生成多个候选输出，评估每个候选的正确性和不确定性，然后通过不确定性引导的长度校准模块估计问题难度。对低难度正确输出惩罚长推理路径，对高难度错误输出鼓励扩展思维链。

Result: 在六个公开医疗问答基准测试中，平均实现了6.4倍的推理长度减少，同时性能仅有最小程度的下降。模型自发形成了"不思考"和"思考"两种推理模式。

Conclusion: AdaThink-Med框架有效提升了医疗大语言模型的自适应思维能力，在性能和计算成本之间取得了良好平衡，能够动态抑制冗余推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought
have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and
medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in
lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question,
leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore,
enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and
think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs
in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches
designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while
providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and
computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first
end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical
reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first
generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the
correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem
difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs
with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer
reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers,
it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions.
On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length
reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation.
Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct
reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking",
demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes
dynamically.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统研究阅读障碍的方法在测试因果关系方面存在局限，需要新的计算框架来研究阅读障碍的潜在机制

Method: 在视觉语言模型中识别视觉词汇形式选择性单元，并针对性消融这些单元，同时保持随机单元的消融作为对照

Result: 针对性消融词汇处理单元导致阅读任务选择性受损，而一般视觉和语言理解能力保持完整，模型复制了阅读障碍者的语音缺陷特征

Conclusion: 该建模结果复制了阅读障碍的关键特征，为研究阅读障碍建立了一个计算框架

Abstract: Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading
difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area
in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying
dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable
insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use
large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally
identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using
stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective
units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike
ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while
general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In
particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits
without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our
modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a
computational framework for investigating reading disorders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多语言自动语音识别有所进展，但语码转换（日常语音中常见的语言混合现象）仍然是一个严重未被充分探索的挑战。

Method: 提出HiKE框架，包含高质量自然语码转换数据、借词标签和分层语码转换标注方案（词级、短语级、句子级）。

Result: 评估显示大多数多语言ASR模型在语码转换ASR上表现不佳，但通过使用语码转换数据进行微调可以显著提升性能。

Conclusion: HiKE为韩英语码转换研究提供了首个可访问的评估框架，证明了语码转换能力可以通过数据微调来激活，将促进该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Despite advances in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR),
code-switching (CS), the mixing of languages within an utterance common in
daily speech, remains a severely underexplored challenge. In this paper, we
introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the
first globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to
provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to
foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of
high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides
meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word,
phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's
ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of
diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper
demonstrates that while most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with
CS-ASR, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data. HiKE

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学领域中的宣传性语言（炒作）日益增多，可能破坏证据的客观评估、阻碍研究发展并侵蚀对科学的信任，因此需要开发自动检测方法。

Method: 制定正式的炒作语言识别指南，在NIH基金申请语料库上进行人工标注，然后评估传统文本分类器和语言模型的性能，并与人类基准进行比较。

Result: 实验表明，正式的标注指南有助于人类可靠地标注候选炒作形容词，使用标注数据集训练机器学习模型可获得有前景的结果。

Conclusion: 该任务具有语言复杂性，可能需要领域知识和时间意识。这是首次将炒作检测作为自然语言处理任务进行研究。

Abstract: In science, promotional language ('hype') is increasing and can undermine
objective evaluation of evidence, impede research development, and erode trust
in science. In this paper, we introduce the task of automatic detection of
hype, which we define as hyperbolic or subjective language that authors use to
glamorize, promote, embellish, or exaggerate aspects of their research. We
propose formalized guidelines for identifying hype language and apply them to
annotate a portion of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant application
corpus. We then evaluate traditional text classifiers and language models on
this task, comparing their performance with a human baseline. Our experiments
show that formalizing annotation guidelines can help humans reliably annotate
candidate hype adjectives and that using our annotated dataset to train machine
learning models yields promising results. Our findings highlight the linguistic
complexity of the task, and the potential need for domain knowledge and
temporal awareness of the facts. While some linguistic works address hype
detection, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach it as a
natural language processing task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer的自注意力机制在处理长序列时面临严重的计算和内存瓶颈，现有可训练稀疏注意力方法引入过多额外参数，且破坏了"短序列预训练、长序列微调"的工作流程。

Method: 提出密集-稀疏可切换注意力框架InfLLM-V2，通过参数复用实现短长序列处理的一致性，短输入使用密集注意力，长序列平滑过渡到稀疏注意力，并提供高效实现减少计算开销。

Conclusion: InfLLM-V2成功解决了长序列处理的计算瓶颈，在保持高性能的同时显著提升效率，为研究社区提供了可复现的实现方案。

Abstract: Long-sequence processing is a critical capability for modern large language
models. However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer
architecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing
long sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising
solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters
and disrupt the conventional \textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long}
workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention
framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that
seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2
reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture
modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence
processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all
sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly
transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical
acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2
that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on
long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that
InfLLM-V2 is 4$\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and
99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we
have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1
(https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model,
providing a reproducible implementation for the research community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了unPact框架，通过提示归因和贡献跟踪来可解释地分析大语言模型的知识遗忘机制。研究发现现有遗忘方法要么效果不足（知识可通过关键词强调恢复），要么过于破坏性（导致灾难性遗忘）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的知识遗忘方法效果存在争议，一方面被遗忘的知识可以通过微调恢复，另一方面遗忘可能导致灾难性遗忘。由于难以追踪LLMs复杂架构中的知识，缺乏对遗忘机制的可解释性分析。

Method: 提出unPact框架，通过量化提示中每个标记对输出的影响，进行遗忘前后的比较分析。在6种主流遗忘方法、3种LLMs和3个基准测试上进行评估。

Result: 发现：(1)遗忘通过破坏对提示关键词的关注而显得有效；(2)大部分知识并未真正删除，仅通过强调提示中的关键词即可恢复；(3)灾难性遗忘源于对所有标记的无差别惩罚。

Conclusion: 现有遗忘方法面临两难困境：要么效果不足（知识可恢复），要么过于破坏性（性能崩溃），距离可靠的遗忘仍有差距。

Abstract: Unlearning seeks to remove specific knowledge from large language models
(LLMs), but its effectiveness remains contested. On one side, "forgotten"
knowledge can often be recovered through interventions such as light
fine-tuning; on the other side, unlearning may induce catastrophic forgetting
that degrades general capabilities. Despite active exploration of unlearning
methods, interpretability analyses of the mechanism are scarce due to the
difficulty of tracing knowledge in LLMs' complex architectures. We address this
gap by proposing unPact, an interpretable framework for unlearning via prompt
attribution and contribution tracking. Typically, it quantifies each prompt
token's influence on outputs, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons to
reveal what changes. Across six mainstream unlearning methods, three LLMs, and
three benchmarks, we find that: (1) Unlearning appears to be effective by
disrupting focus on keywords in prompt; (2) Much of the knowledge is not truly
erased and can be recovered by simply emphasizing these keywords in prompts,
without modifying the model's weights; (3) Catastrophic forgetting arises from
indiscriminate penalization of all tokens. Taken together, our results suggest
an unlearning dilemma: existing methods tend either to be insufficient -
knowledge remains recoverable by keyword emphasis, or overly destructive -
general performance collapses due to catastrophic forgetting, still leaving a
gap to reliable unlearning.

TL;DR: 本文研究了无参考情况下单次LLM作为评判者的可靠性问题，提出了Latent Judges方法，通过内部模型信号获得更稳定和细粒度的评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用LLM作为评判者进行Likert量表评分存在两个系统性问题：评分在采样下不稳定且校准不佳，导致评分集中在量表顶部和频繁出现平局。

Method: 提出了三种Latent Judges方法：(i)基于整数评分的概率加权评分，(ii)验证器式的"是"概率，(iii)在评分位置训练的线性探针模型。

Result: 在广泛的成对和单评分基准测试中，潜在方法匹配或超越了标准提示方法，在成对准确性和列表排序方面有持续提升。概率加权评分在单评分相关性方面表现最强，而探针方法在输出logits校准不佳时能恢复有用信号。

Conclusion: 潜在信息为无参考评估提供了确定性和更具区分度的信号，可以改进选择和训练方法如Best-of-N、多教师蒸馏和路由。

Abstract: How reliable are single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references,
and can we obtain fine-grained, deterministic scores in this setting? We study
the common practice of asking a judge model to assign Likert-scale scores to
free-text responses and show two systematic issues: scores are unstable under
sampling and poorly calibrated, leading to compression near the top of the
scale and frequent ties. We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which
derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted
scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and
(iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across
a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or
surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and
listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores
achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful
signals when output logits are miscalibrated. These results indicate that
latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for
reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches
like Best-of-$N$, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

TL;DR: MemGen是一个动态生成式记忆框架，为LLM智能体提供类人认知能力，通过记忆触发器和记忆编织器实现推理与记忆的紧密交织，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆范式存在局限：参数化记忆强制调整模型参数，检索式记忆将经验外部化到结构化数据库，但都无法捕捉人类认知中推理与记忆的流动交织。

Method: MemGen包含记忆触发器（监控智能体推理状态以决定显式记忆调用）和记忆编织器（以智能体当前状态为刺激构建潜在token序列作为机器原生记忆来丰富推理）。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，MemGen比领先的外部记忆系统（如ExpeL和AWM）提升高达38.22%，超过GRPO高达13.44%，并表现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: MemGen无需显式监督即可自发演化出类似人类的记忆能力，包括规划记忆、程序性记忆和工作记忆，表明机器认知向更自然形式发展的新兴轨迹。

Abstract: Agent memory shapes how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, akin to
the human brain, progressively refine themselves through environment
interactions. Existing paradigms remain constrained: parametric memory forcibly
adjusts model parameters, and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience
into structured databases, yet neither captures the fluid interweaving of
reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. To address this gap, we
propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a
human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \textit{memory trigger}, which
monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and
a \textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to
construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its
reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent
memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and
cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen
surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to
$38.22\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit
supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties,
including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an
emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.

Method: 提出三智能体协同进化框架：求解器从成功和失败轨迹中学习，教师根据求解器弱点设计挑战性问题，生成器蒸馏教师策略实现可扩展课程生成。

Result: 仅用100个种子问题，Socratic-Solver-8B在7个数学推理基准上平均提升20.2个百分点，Socratic-Generator-32B生成的数据使学生LLM性能超越多个SOTA商业LLM。

Conclusion: Socratic-Zero证明了完全自主的数据生成框架能够产生高质量训练数据，显著提升模型性能，无需预定义任务或标签。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks rely
heavily on massive, high-quality datasets-typically human-annotated and thus
difficult to scale. While data synthesis or distillation offers a promising
alternative, existing methods struggle with inconsistent data quality and an
inability to dynamically adapt to the evolving capabilities of the model,
leading to suboptimal training signals. To address these limitations, we
introduce Socratic-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
high-quality training data from minimal seed examples through the co-evolution
of three agents: the Teacher, the Solver, and the Generator. The Solver
continuously refines its reasoning by learning from preference feedback on both
successful and failed trajectories; the Teacher adaptively crafts increasingly
challenging questions based on the Solver's weaknesses; and the Generator
distills the Teacher's question-design strategy to enable scalable,
high-fidelity curriculum generation. This closed-loop system produces a
self-improving curriculum-requiring no pre-existing tasks or labels.
Remarkably, starting from only 100 seed questions, our Socratic-Solver-8B
achieves an average gain of +20.2 percentage points over prior data synthesis
methods across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24-25,
Olympiad, MATH-500, Minerva, and GSM8K), with consistent gains on both Qwen3
and GLM4 series models. Even more surprisingly, synthetic data from
Socratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to achieve superior performance
compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) commercial LLMs on these benchmarks,
including Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4,
and Claude-4.1-Opus.

Motivation: 现有动态估计块重要性的方法在稀疏率较高时会导致性能下降，需要更精细的块重要性评估方法。

Method: 利用注意力头之间的相似性，使用代表性代理头的分数来近似所有头的分数，并结合块感知动态预算估计方法。

Result: 在主流模型和基准测试中验证了注意力头之间的相似性，ProxyAttn实现了10.3倍注意力加速和2.4倍预填充加速，且无明显性能损失。

Conclusion: ProxyAttn通过精细化的块重要性评估，在低计算成本下实现了性能和效率的显著提升。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits the efficiency of
Large Language Models (LLMs) on long-text tasks. Recently, methods that
dynamically estimate block importance have enabled efficient block sparse
attention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of
LLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance
degradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a
training-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block
estimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our
observation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores
of pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To
account for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware
dynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative
proxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained
block importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety
of mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity
among attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed
method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to
existing methods. More precisely, ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention
acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance

*Guibin Zhang,Fanci Meng,Guancheng Wan,Zherui Li,Kun Wang,Zhenfei Yin,Lei Bai,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LatentEvolve是一个自进化的潜在测试时缩放框架，通过模拟人类大脑的双系统学习机制，在无需监督的情况下提升LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法相互独立，LLM尚未学会如何渐进式地更有效地进行缩放计算。目标是让LLM学会"如何缩放测试时计算"。

Method: 受互补学习系统理论启发，采用双组件进化框架：白天缩放（快速检索历史潜在表示）和夜间缩放（整合过去潜在优化），模拟人类认知动态。

Result: 在8个基准测试和5个模型骨干上的实验表明，LatentEvolve比最先进的TTS方法（如LatentSeek和TTRL）性能提升高达13.33%，并展现出卓越的跨域和跨骨干泛化能力。

Conclusion: LatentEvolve通过模拟人类大脑的快速回忆和慢速巩固机制，成功实现了LLM测试时缩放能力的自进化，显著提升了推理性能。

Abstract: Test-time Scaling (TTS) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during the inference
phase without altering model parameters. However, existing TTS methods are
largely independent, implying that LLMs have not yet evolved to progressively
learn how to scale more effectively. With the objective of evolving LLMs to
learn ``how to scale test-time computation,'' we propose LatentEvolve, a
self-evolving latent TTS framework inspired by the complementary learning
system (CLS) theory. Analogous to the human brain's dual system of a
fast-recall hippocampus and a slow-consolidating neocortex, LatentEvolve
comprises two evolutionary components: \textit{daytime scaling}, which rapidly
retrieves historical latent representations to better guide current LLM
reasoning; and \textit{nighttime scaling}, which integrates past latent
optimizations in a manner akin to the human brain's consolidation of
experiences during sleep. The alternation of daytime and nighttime processes
facilitates a fast and slow evolution of LLM TTS, mirroring human cognitive
dynamics in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks and five model backbones demonstrate that our LatentEvolve surpasses
state-of-the-art TTS methods such as LatentSeek and TTRL by up to $13.33\%$ and
exhibits exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeaPO是一种战略错误放大方法，通过在模型偏好优化中引入三种常见错误类型，确保负样本比正样本更错误，从而增强模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法在偏好优化时，由于模型评分或生成能力有限，正负样本质量可能变得相似，这使偏好学习优化变得复杂。

Method: 使用战略错误放大方法，在模型偏好优化中引入LLMs常见的三种错误类型，通过偏好训练来减少这些错误的发生。

Result: 在五个能力维度和不同模型规模（1.5B到14B）上的评估显示，生成的数据显著提升了整体模型性能，特别是在真实性方面提升了5-10个百分点。

Conclusion: 任务性能取决于引入的错误类型：注入最常见错误类型可提升相关任务性能，而混合错误类型则带来更广泛的性能提升。

Abstract: Existing alignment methods for preference optimization of large language
models (LLMs) aim to enhance model performance by utilizing pairs of positive
and negative samples. However, due to the limited capacity of models in scoring
or generating responses, the quality of positive and negative samples may
become similar during training, which complicates optimization for preference
learning. To address this issue, we introduce SeaPO, a Strategic Error
Amplification method that leverages three error types commonly occurring in
LLMs to introduce specific error patterns into the model Preference
Optimization. This strategy ensures that negative samples are more erroneous
than positive samples and preference-based training is employed to mitigate the
occurrence of these errors, thereby enhancing model performance. Evaluations
across five capability dimensions and different model scales (1.5B to 14B)
demonstrate that the generated data significantly improved overall model
performance, particularly in terms of truthfulness, with improvements of 5-10
percentage points observed. Further analysis reveals that task performance
varies depending on the error types introduced. Injecting the most common error
types improves performance in related tasks, while a mix of error types leads
to a broader performance enhancement: most tasks show stable improvements,
while a few tasks exhibit significant gains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于树结构的自动评估指标，用于评估LLM生成的逐步组装指令，相比传统指标能更准确反映构建的时空特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标如BLEU和BERT相似度分数无法充分捕捉组装指令的时空特性，需要更准确的评估方法。

Method: 开发了基于树结构的自动评估指标，应用于缝纫指令领域，并与人工标注的错误计数和人类质量评分进行相关性分析。

Result: 新指标与人工标注错误计数和人类质量评分的相关性更好，对专门设计来混淆文本相似度指标的对抗性示例更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于树的评估指标在评估缝纫指令的时空合理性方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel, automatic tree-based evaluation metric for
LLM-generated step-by-step assembly instructions, that more accurately reflects
spatiotemporal aspects of construction than traditional metrics such as BLEU
and BERT similarity scores. We apply our proposed metric to the domain of
sewing instructions, and show that our metric better correlates with
manually-annotated error counts as well as human quality ratings, demonstrating
our metric's superiority for evaluating the spatiotemporal soundness of sewing
instructions. Further experiments show that our metric is more robust than
traditional approaches against artificially-constructed counterfactual examples
that are specifically constructed to confound metrics that rely on textual
similarity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KnowGuard提出了一个"调查-再弃权"的新范式，通过系统性的知识图谱探索来改进临床决策中的弃权机制，在诊断准确性和交互效率方面均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在医疗场景中缺乏有效的弃权机制，经常在信息不足时给出过度自信的回答，这源于传统方法仅依赖模型自评估而缺乏系统性识别知识边界的外部医学证据。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1)证据发现阶段通过图谱扩展和直接检索系统探索医学知识空间；2)证据评估阶段基于患者上下文和对话历史对证据进行多因素排序，实现自适应探索。

Result: 在开放式多轮临床基准测试中，KnowGuard优于最先进的弃权方法，诊断准确率提高3.93%，同时平均减少7.27次不必要的交互。

Conclusion: KnowGuard通过系统性的知识图谱探索实现了有效的临床决策弃权机制，显著提升了诊断准确性和交互效率。

Abstract: In clinical practice, physicians refrain from making decisions when patient
information is insufficient. This behavior, known as abstention, is a critical
safety mechanism preventing potentially harmful misdiagnoses. Recent
investigations have reported the application of large language models (LLMs) in
medical scenarios. However, existing LLMs struggle with the abstentions,
frequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information.
This limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on
model self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge
boundaries with external medical evidences. To address this, we propose
\textbf{KnowGuard}, a novel \textit{investigate-before-abstain} paradigm that
integrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making.
Our approach consists of two key stages operating on a shared contextualized
evidence pool: 1) an evidence discovery stage that systematically explores the
medical knowledge space through graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) an
evidence evaluation stage that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt
exploration based on patient context and conversation history. This two-stage
approach enables systematic knowledge graph exploration, allowing models to
trace structured reasoning paths and recognize insufficient medical evidence.
We evaluate our abstention approach using open-ended multi-round clinical
benchmarks that mimic realistic diagnostic scenarios, assessing abstention
quality through accuracy-efficiency trade-offs beyond existing closed-form
evaluations. Experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that KnowGuard
outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic
accuracy by 3.93\% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on
average.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DiaCDM模型，将认知诊断应用于师生对话场景，解决了传统认知诊断模型难以处理动态、非结构化对话的问题，通过教育理论中的IRE框架和图编码方法提高了诊断准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知诊断模型无法有效处理师生对话的动态非结构化数据，难以从冗长对话中准确提取诊断语义，需要开发专门针对对话场景的认知诊断方法。

Method: 基于教育理论中的IRE（发起-回应-评价）框架设计诊断框架，开发了结合教师问题和相关知识点的图编码方法，更精确地捕捉关键信息。

Result: 在三个真实对话数据集上的实验表明，DiaCDM显著提高了诊断准确性，同时增强了结果的可解释性，为教师评估学生认知状态提供了有力工具。

Conclusion: DiaCDM是首个在对话场景中探索认知诊断的研究，成功解决了传统模型在对话环境中的局限性，为教育领域的认知诊断应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: While cognitive diagnosis (CD) effectively assesses students' knowledge
mastery from structured test data, applying it to real-world teacher-student
dialogues presents two fundamental challenges. Traditional CD models lack a
suitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's
difficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To
overcome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted
the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to
design a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique
graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant
knowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our
knowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue
setting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM
not only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the
results' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for
assessing students' cognitive states. The code is available at

### [165] [SemShareKV: Efficient KVCache Sharing for Semantically Similar Prompts via Token-Level LSH Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24832)
*Xinye Zhao,Spyridon Mastorakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemShareKV是一个KV缓存共享和压缩框架，通过重用语义相似提示的KV缓存来加速LLM推理，使用局部敏感哈希进行模糊令牌匹配，并整合旋转位置嵌入来保持位置信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模扩大，推理过程中键值缓存的内存占用已成为显著瓶颈。现有方法主要关注单提示内的KV缓存压缩或跨提示共享前缀，但在语义相似但词汇不同的场景中效果有限。

Method: 应用局部敏感哈希对令牌嵌入进行模糊令牌匹配，整合旋转位置嵌入来更好地保持位置信息，通过选择性重用参考提示缓存中的相关键值对来减少冗余计算。

Result: 在多样化摘要数据集上实验显示，对于5k令牌输入，最高达到6.25倍加速和42%的GPU内存使用降低，质量退化可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 语义感知的缓存共享在高效LLM推理方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of
key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck.
Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single
prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across
prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are
semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks
such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose
\textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that
accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts.
Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token
matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and
incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional
information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference
prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining
output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to
6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with
negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of
semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

TL;DR: 提出分层错误修正框架(HEC)，通过系统错误分析和针对性干预策略，在专业领域提升大语言模型性能，平均提升11.2个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在专业领域表现不佳，在医疗编码任务中仅达到45.9%准确率，需要专门的方法来提升其专业领域性能。

Method: 分析四个专业领域的错误模式，发现错误遵循分层结构：知识层(58.4%)、推理层(39.6%)和复杂度层(2.0%)。基于此开发三阶段修正框架，按层次重要性处理错误。

Result: 在医疗转录(4,921例)、法律文档分类(1,000例)、政治偏见检测(645例)和法律推理(1,000例)中均显示一致改进。跨五个LLM架构验证显示平均提升11.2个百分点(p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: 系统错误分析可以指导专业领域AI增强策略，特别适用于中等基线任务，同时需要理解框架边界以实现最优部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models face significant performance challenges in specialized
domains, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 45.9% accuracy on medical
coding tasks. This study proposes a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC)
framework that addresses domain-specific AI limitations through systematic
error analysis and targeted intervention strategies.
  We analyze error patterns across four specialized domains and find that AI
errors follow consistent hierarchical structures: Knowledge-layer errors
(58.4%), Reasoning-layer errors (39.6%), and Complexity-layer errors (2.0%).
Based on these patterns, we develop a three-stage correction framework that
addresses errors according to their hierarchical importance and demonstrates
that framework effectiveness correlates inversely with baseline task
performance.
  Experimental validation across medical transcription (4,921 cases), legal
document classification (1,000 cases), political bias detection (645 cases),
and legal reasoning (1,000 cases) shows consistent improvements. Cross-model
validation across five LLM architectures demonstrates average improvements of
11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001). However, analysis reveals framework
limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy), where hierarchical
intervention may interfere with effective reasoning processes.
  The results suggest that systematic error analysis can guide effective AI
enhancement strategies in specialized domains, particularly for
moderate-baseline tasks, while highlighting the importance of understanding
framework boundaries for optimal deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在心理健康危机检测和响应方面的能力，发现虽然模型在明确危机披露时表现一致可靠，但在处理间接风险信号时存在系统性弱点，且存在不当或有害响应的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT等LLM聊天机器人在高风险心理健康支持场景中的广泛应用，需要评估其安全检测和响应急性心理健康危机的能力，但目前缺乏统一的危机分类体系、标注基准和基于临床实践的实证评估。

Method: 引入六个临床心理健康危机类别的统一分类法，构建多样化评估数据集，建立专家设计的响应适当性评估协议，系统性地对三种最先进LLM进行危机分类和安全响应生成能力的基准测试。

Result: LLM在处理明确危机披露时高度一致且可靠，但存在显著风险：相当比例响应被评为不当或有害，开源模型失败率高于商业模型；在处理间接或模糊风险信号时存在系统性弱点，依赖公式化默认回复，经常与用户情境不匹配。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LLM部署中迫切需要加强安全保障、改进危机检测和情境感知干预。该分类法、数据集和评估框架为AI驱动心理健康支持的持续研究和负责任创新奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread use of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) such
as ChatGPT and Llama has fundamentally reshaped how people seek information and
advice across domains. Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in
high-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns.
While LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and
respond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is
hampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated
benchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In
this work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six
clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse
evaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing
response appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art
LLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate
responses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and
generally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks
remain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or
harmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher
failure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify
systemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance
on formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with
user context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced
safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM
deployments. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework lay the
groundwork for ongoing research and responsible innovation in AI-driven mental
health support, helping to minimize harm and better protect vulnerable users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐喻是话语的普遍特征，但大规模分析受限于需要手动标注，因为隐喻具有语境敏感性。本研究旨在利用LLMs自动化隐喻识别。

Method: 比较三种方法：检索增强生成(RAG)、提示工程(包括零样本、少样本和思维链策略)和微调。使用最先进的闭源LLMs进行实验。

Result: 微调方法表现最佳，中位F1分数达到0.79。人类与LLM输出的差异大多是系统性的，反映了隐喻理论中的灰色区域和概念挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs可以至少部分自动化隐喻识别，并可作为开发和改进隐喻识别协议及其理论基础的工具。

Abstract: Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for
examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has
been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive
nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare
three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is
provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules
and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal
instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded
texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot,
few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that
state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning
yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs
reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey
areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be
used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a
testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the
theory that underpins them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型是否能在推理时利用人工插入的填充标记序列作为额外计算空间，而不是依赖训练时的特殊标记。

Method: 识别有效的标记类型、数量和插入位置，分析模型训练阶段开始利用扩展计算空间的时机，通过注意力图分析空间内的动态。

Result: 在1.7B到32B模型上的实验显示，适当的标记类型和数量各不相同，但将填充标记直接放在最终'Answer:'标记前最有效。小模型受益最大，SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct提升达12.372个百分点。

Conclusion: 扩展空间作为额外计算容量而非冗余输入，注意力图显示这些空间通常延续原始注意力机制，有时聚焦于问题或答案选项，表明为问题解决进行了有意义的计算。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationale enables language models to use additional
task-related text for problem-solving, benefiting not only from detailed
reasoning steps but also from the expanded computational space of longer
inputs. Prior work has trained filler or special tokens to serve as additional
computation spaces. In this study, we investigate whether language models can
leverage artificially inserted sequences of filler tokens solely at inference.
We first identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, then
examine at what stage of training models begin to exploit the expanded
computation space, and finally analyze dynamics within these spaces via
attention maps. Experiments on models ranging from 1.7B to 32B across
open-domain QA and math tasks show that appropriate token types and counts
vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final 'Answer:' token is
most effective. Smaller models benefit most, up to 12.372 percentage points in
SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, indicating that these spaces act as additional
computational capacity rather than redundant input. Attention maps reveal that
expanded spaces often continue the original attention mechanism and sometimes
focus on questions or answer options, suggesting meaningful computation for
problem-solving.

Motivation: 由于信息过载，长文档摘要能力日益重要，但西班牙语文档特别是法律领域缺乏此类摘要资源。

Method: 构建BOE-XSUM数据集，包含摘要、原文和文档类型标签，并在该数据集上微调中等规模LLM，与零样本通用模型进行对比。

Result: 微调模型显著优于非专业化模型，最佳模型BERTIN GPT-J 6B比最佳零样本模型DeepSeek-R1性能提升24%（准确率41.6% vs 33.5%）。

Conclusion: 领域特定的微调能显著提升LLM在法律文档摘要任务上的性能，BOE-XSUM数据集填补了西班牙语法律文档摘要资源的空白。

Abstract: The ability to summarize long documents succinctly is increasingly important
in daily life due to information overload, yet there is a notable lack of such
summaries for Spanish documents in general, and in the legal domain in
particular. In this work, we present BOE-XSUM, a curated dataset comprising
3,648 concise, plain-language summaries of documents sourced from Spain's
``Bolet\'{\i}n Oficial del Estado'' (BOE), the State Official Gazette. Each
entry in the dataset includes a short summary, the original text, and its
document type label. We evaluate the performance of medium-sized large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuned on BOE-XSUM, comparing them to general-purpose
generative models in a zero-shot setting. Results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their non-specialized counterparts. Notably, the
best-performing model -- BERTIN GPT-J 6B (32-bit precision) -- achieves a 24\%
performance gain over the top zero-shot model, DeepSeek-R1 (accuracies of
41.6\% vs.\ 33.5\%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型能生成流畅文本，但其复制特定人类作者独特风格的能力尚不明确，需要开发有效的验证和分析方法。

Method: 集成TF-IDF字符n-gram与transformer嵌入，使用经验距离分布进行文本对分类，无需监督训练或阈值调整。

Result: 在学术论文上达到97.5%准确率，跨域评估94.5%，相比参数基线减少91.8%训练时间和59%内存使用。LLM风格模仿分析显示提示策略比模型大小影响更大，few-shot提示比zero-shot高23.5倍风格匹配准确率。

Conclusion: 风格保真度和统计可检测性是可分离的，为未来作者建模、检测和身份条件生成提供了可复现的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, but their ability to
replicate the distinctive style of a specific human author remains unclear. We
present a fast, training-free framework for authorship verification and style
imitation analysis. The method integrates TF-IDF character n-grams with
transformer embeddings and classifies text pairs through empirical distance
distributions, eliminating the need for supervised training or threshold
tuning. It achieves 97.5\% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5\% in
cross-domain evaluation, while reducing training time by 91.8\% and memory
usage by 59\% relative to parameter-based baselines. Using this framework, we
evaluate five LLMs from three separate families (Llama, Qwen, Mixtral) across
four prompting strategies - zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and text completion.
Results show that the prompting strategy has a more substantial influence on
style fidelity than model size: few-shot prompting yields up to 23.5x higher
style-matching accuracy than zero-shot, and completion prompting reaches 99.9\%
agreement with the original author's style. Crucially, high-fidelity imitation
does not imply human-like unpredictability - human essays average a perplexity
of 29.5, whereas matched LLM outputs average only 15.2. These findings
demonstrate that stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are
separable, establishing a reproducible basis for future work in authorship
modeling, detection, and identity-conditioned generation.

Method: 通过设计指标筛选高质量开源数据集，仅使用约2T token进行预训练，再通过4.2T token的重新采样数据集进行训练，结合标准后训练流程。

Conclusion: 高质量数据比数据规模更重要，精心筛选的小数据集足以训练出强大的推理模型，为资源受限环境下的模型开发提供了新方向。

Abstract: The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses
to chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1)
reasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such
capabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption
has already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models
such as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely
unquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely
large corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and
resampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our
designed metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge
with far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality
data are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled
from these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure,
enables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter
reasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully
open-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of
15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B.
Remarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to
Qwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches
or surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate
further research in this direction, we have released the complete training
recipe, data sources, data mixing ratio, and model checkpoints, together with
the key insights obtained throughout this study.

*Linlu Gong,Ante Wang,Yunghwei Lai,Weizhi Ma,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAQuE是最大的医疗多轮问答自动评估基准，包含3000个模拟患者代理，评估框架涵盖任务成功、询问能力、对话能力、询问效率和患者体验等多个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI医生主要关注诊断技能，但忽视了同理心、耐心和清晰沟通等其他重要医生素质，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含3000个模拟患者代理的基准，这些代理具有多样语言模式、认知限制、情绪反应和被动披露倾向，并引入多维度评估框架。

Result: 实验显示不同LLM在评估方面面临重大挑战，最先进模型在询问能力方面仍有很大改进空间，对真实患者行为变化高度敏感，影响诊断准确性。

Conclusion: 细粒度指标揭示了不同评估维度之间的权衡，突出了在现实临床环境中平衡性能和实用性的挑战。

Abstract: An effective physician should possess a combination of empathy, expertise,
patience, and clear communication when treating a patient. Recent advances have
successfully endowed AI doctors with expert diagnostic skills, particularly the
ability to actively seek information through inquiry. However, other essential
qualities of a good doctor remain overlooked. To bridge this gap, we present
MAQuE(Medical Agent Questioning Evaluation), the largest-ever benchmark for the
automatic and comprehensive evaluation of medical multi-turn questioning. It
features 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents that exhibit diverse
linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and tendencies
for passive disclosure. We also introduce a multi-faceted evaluation framework,
covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry
efficiency, and patient experience. Experiments on different LLMs reveal
substantial challenges across the evaluation aspects. Even state-of-the-art
models show significant room for improvement in their inquiry capabilities.
These models are highly sensitive to variations in realistic patient behavior,
which considerably impacts diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, our fine-grained
metrics expose trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives,
highlighting the challenge of balancing performance and practicality in
real-world clinical settings.

*Kaihong Li,Huichi Zhou,Bin Ma,Fangjun Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段的检测框架SemanticShield，通过整合项目侧语义信息来防御推荐系统中的shilling攻击，使用LLM进行语义一致性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要关注用户侧行为，忽视了项目侧特征（如标题和描述）可能暴露恶意意图的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段检测：第一阶段使用低成本行为标准预筛选可疑用户，第二阶段使用基于LLM的审计评估语义一致性。通过强化微调在轻量级LLM上设计奖励函数，开发专门的检测器。

Result: 在六种代表性攻击策略上的实验证明了SemanticShield的有效性，对未见过的攻击方法也显示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SemanticShield通过整合项目侧语义信息，为推荐系统提供了有效的shilling攻击防御方案，具有良好泛化性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are widely used in e-commerce for personalized
suggestions, yet their openness makes them susceptible to shilling attacks,
where adversaries inject fake behaviors to manipulate recommendations. Most
existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side
features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To
address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates
item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage
pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second
stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore,
we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a
lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a
specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative
attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against
shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods
shows its strong generalization capability. Code is available at

*Hanqi Xiao,Vaidehi Patil,Hyunji Lee,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM置信度估计不是依赖于模型自省，而是通过学习历史正确性数据的通用技能。提出广义正确性模型(GCM)，通过注入历史正确性信息来改进置信度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成准确且校准的置信度估计对于高风险应用中的LLM部署至关重要，但现有方法假设模型具有判断自身答案正确性的特权信息，而实验表明这种自省方法效果有限。

Method: 提出广义正确性模型(GCM)，通过注入目标模型的历史预测正确性信息来训练。探索了多种方法：训练GCM学习跨模型和数据集的正确定性模式；使用历史作为上下文示例；后处理校准。

Result: GCM在5个模型家族和MMLU、TriviaQA数据集上表现良好，在选择性预测任务中有效。发现答案措辞是正确性的强预测因子，历史正确性信息比模型自省更重要。

Conclusion: 可靠的LLM置信度估计是通过系统编码正确性历史学习的通用、模型无关技能，而非依赖于模型特定自省能力的技能。

Abstract: Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open
challenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting
a model's "self-knowledge", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its
own answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some
privileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the
model itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict
the correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an
unrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a
"Correctness Model" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical
predictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness
information, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that
GCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns
for correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use
CMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its
generalization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that
answer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore
alternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that
including history as in-context examples can help improve correctness
prediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in
calibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families
and the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective
prediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a
generalizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding
correctness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on
self-introspection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型蒸馏只关注行为模仿，将教师模型的内部计算视为黑盒。本文旨在蒸馏教师模型实现的基础计算机制。

Method: 提出电路蒸馏方法：识别师生模型中功能对应的电路组件，引入对齐这些组件内部表示的损失函数，仅调整学生模型的小部分参数。

Result: 在Llama3系列模型的实体跟踪和心智理论任务上，电路蒸馏优于标准蒸馏，成功通过调整少量目标参数转移算法能力。

Conclusion: 电路蒸馏证明了机制转移的可行性，可通过解释性和可控的内部学生机制高效蒸馏特定教师能力。

Abstract: Model distillation typically focuses on behavioral mimicry, where a student
model is trained to replicate a teacher's output while treating its internal
computations as a black box. In this work we propose an alternative approach:
Distilling the underlying computational mechanisms implemented by a teacher
model. Specifically, we propose circuit distillation, which introduces an
objective to align internal representations between analogous circuit
components in teacher and student models. We propose a method to match
``functionally correspondent'' circuit components and introduce a loss
reflecting similarities between the representations that these induce. We
evaluate circuit distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind (ToM) tasks
using models from the Llama3 family. Our results demonstrate that circuit
distillation outperforms standard distillation, successfully transferring
algorithmic capabilities by adjusting only a small, targeted subset of student
model parameters. This work establishes the feasibility of transferring
mechanisms, which may in turn allow for efficient distillation of targeted
teacher capabilities via interpretable and controllable internal student
mechanisms.

TL;DR: DiDi-Instruct是一种基于训练的快速语言生成方法，通过从预训练的离散扩散语言模型初始化，实现64倍加速，在OpenWebText上性能优于GPT-2基线和标准dLLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 追求AI时代快速生成语言文本的圣杯目标，解决语言生成速度问题。

Method: 基于积分KL散度最小化框架，从预训练离散扩散语言模型初始化，采用分组奖励归一化、中间状态匹配和奖励引导祖先采样等技术。

Result: 在OpenWebText上，DiDi-Instruct在8到128次函数评估中实现62.2到18.4的困惑度，仅损失约1%的熵，训练时间减少20倍，性能优于所有加速语言生成模型。

Conclusion: DiDi-Instruct是一种高效有效的蒸馏方法，能够实现眨眼间的语言生成，并通过蛋白质序列生成验证了其鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the
AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct
(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation
models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language
model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM
counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical
part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of
integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We
also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state
matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly
improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference
performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated
language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard
dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128
NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss
of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further
validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive
ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein
sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective
distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We
will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

TL;DR: 提出了GateMABSA，一种新颖的门控多模态架构，用于解决多模态方面情感分析中的视觉噪声和跨模态对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态方面情感分析模型难以过滤噪声视觉信号，并有效对齐跨模态的方面和意见内容。

Method: 集成句法、语义和融合感知mLSTM的门控多模态架构，包括Syn-mLSTM（句法结构）、Sem-mLSTM（方面-语义相关性）和Fuse-mLSTM（选择性多模态融合）。

Result: 在两个基准Twitter数据集上的广泛实验表明，GateMABSA优于多个基线模型。

Conclusion: GateMABSA通过专门设计的门控机制有效解决了多模态方面情感分析中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has recently advanced into the
multimodal domain, where user-generated content often combines text and images.
However, existing multimodal ABSA (MABSA) models struggle to filter noisy
visual signals, and effectively align aspects with opinion-bearing content
across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GateMABSA, a novel
gated multimodal architecture that integrates syntactic, semantic, and
fusion-aware mLSTM. Specifically, GateMABSA introduces three specialized
mLSTMs: Syn-mLSTM to incorporate syntactic structure, Sem-mLSTM to emphasize
aspect--semantic relevance, and Fuse-mLSTM to perform selective multimodal
fusion. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Twitter datasets demonstrate
that GateMABSA outperforms several baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM向量空间信息解码方法——超维探针，结合符号表示和神经探测，通过向量符号架构将残差流投影到可解释概念中，克服了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM可解释性方法（如直接logit归因和稀疏自编码器）存在输出词汇表限制和特征名称不明确等问题，对模型内部表示的理解有限。

Method: 使用向量符号架构（VSAs）将LLM残差流投影到可解释概念空间，结合了稀疏自编码器和传统探针的优点。在输入补全任务和问答设置中验证解码效果。

Result: 实验表明该探针在不同LLM、嵌入大小和输入领域中都能可靠提取有意义概念，并能帮助识别LLM失败情况。

Conclusion: 该方法推进了LLM向量空间中的信息解码，能够从神经表示中提取更具信息性、可解释性和结构化的特征。

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with
limited understanding of their internal representations. Current
interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the
model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces
Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM
vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural
probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via
Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs
and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our
decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's
final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern
recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess
it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both
before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably
extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input
domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information
decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative,
interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信度提示的LLM后处理方法，用于纠正语音识别中的错误，特别针对障碍语音，通过嵌入词级不确定性估计来提升鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为语音识别后处理模块的潜力，专注于纠正障碍语音识别错误，解决传统方法在不确定区域过度修正的问题。

Method: 采用置信度提示方法，将词级不确定性估计直接嵌入LLM训练中，指导模型关注不确定的ASR区域，减少过度修正。使用LLaMA 3.1模型进行微调，并与仅使用转录文本的微调和后验置信度过滤方法进行比较。

Result: 在Speech Accessibility Project自发语音上实现了10%的相对WER降低，在TORGO数据集上实现了47%的降低，证明了置信度感知微调对障碍语音的有效性。

Conclusion: 置信度提示方法显著提升了LLM在障碍语音识别错误纠正中的性能，证明了嵌入不确定性估计对于改善模型鲁棒性和泛化能力的重要性。

Abstract: We investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) as post-processing
modules for automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on their ability to
perform error correction for disordered speech. In particular, we propose
confidence-informed prompting, where word-level uncertainty estimates are
embedded directly into LLM training to improve robustness and generalization
across speakers and datasets. This approach directs the model to uncertain ASR
regions and reduces overcorrection. We fine-tune a LLaMA 3.1 model and compare
our approach to both transcript-only fine-tuning and post hoc confidence-based
filtering. Evaluations show that our method achieves a 10% relative WER
reduction compared to naive LLM correction on the Speech Accessibility Project
spontaneous speech and a 47% reduction on TORGO, demonstrating the
effectiveness of confidence-aware fine-tuning for impaired speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer在程序轨迹生成任务上的表现，该任务通过长轨迹外部化推理过程，每个步骤都很简单，不同于现有的算法问题。

Method: 训练小型Transformer模型，采用多种修改包括替代位置编码、softmax替换、混合模型和短卷积等。

Result: 模型在分布内数据上达到强准确率，但在泛化到各种因素时表现出系统性失败，不过某些设计显著改善了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 虽然Transformer在程序轨迹生成任务上具有强分布内性能，但其泛化能力存在系统性限制，需要通过特定设计改进。

Abstract: We study Transformers on the task \emph{program trace generation} (PTG),
where models produce step-by-step execution traces for synthetic programs.
Unlike existing algorithmic problems, PTG externalizes reasoning through long
traces where each step is trivial. We train small Transformers with diverse
modifications, including alternative position encodings, softmax replacements,
hybrid model, and short convolutions. While these models achieve strong
in-distribution accuracy, they exhibit systematic failures when generalizing to
various factors (e.g., program length, trace steps), though some designs
significantly improve generalization.

Result: 基于DataMind-12K数据集训练的DataMind-14B在多个数据分析基准测试中平均得分71.16%，超越了最强的专有基线DeepSeek-V3.1和GPT-5。DataMind-7B在所有开源模型中表现最佳，得分68.10%。

Conclusion: DataMind框架成功构建了高性能的开源数据分析智能体，为社区提供了可操作的智能体训练见解，并将发布DataMind-12K数据集和DataMind-7B、14B模型供未来研究使用。

Abstract: Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific
discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however,
rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source
models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and
long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This
paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe
designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key
challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient
data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn
rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a
recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and
difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling
strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically
adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a
memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on
DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning
diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic
tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with
an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming
the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B
also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also
incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the
analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic
training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B
for the community's future research.

Motivation: 现有晚期交互模型如ColBERT采用分离编码和多向量匹配，缺乏查询和文档之间的丰富交互。本文旨在开发更紧凑高效的交互机制。

Method: 提出"最后但不晚交互"方法，在同一个上下文窗口中对查询和文档进行因果自注意力计算，然后从每个文档的最后一个令牌提取上下文嵌入。

Result: 在BEIR基准测试中达到61.94 nDCG@10的最先进性能，模型大小仅为0.6B参数，比生成式列表重排序器小十倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过紧凑架构实现了高性能的文档重排序，证明了在查询-文档交互中引入更丰富上下文的有效性。

Abstract: jina-reranker-v3 is a 0.6B parameter multilingual document reranker that
introduces a novel last but not late interaction. Unlike late interaction
models such as ColBERT that perform separate encoding followed by multi-vector
matching, our approach conducts causal self-attention between query and
documents within the same context window, enabling rich cross-document
interactions before extracting contextual embeddings from the last token of
each document. This compact architecture achieves state-of-the-art BEIR
performance with 61.94 nDCG@10 while being ten times smaller than generative
listwise rerankers.

Method: 使用可本地部署的小型LLM，探索知识蒸馏与合成数据、上下文学习作为基线方法，并提出基于输出概率的有害简化过滤策略。

Result: 知识蒸馏提升自动指标但增加有害简化风险，模型输出概率是检测有害简化的有效信号，过滤策略能显著抑制有害简化同时保留有益简化。

Conclusion: 为小型LLM的高效安全词汇简化建立基准，揭示了性能、效率和安全性之间的权衡关系，展示了实际部署的可行方法。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, large language models (LLMs) face
challenges in real-world application of lexical simplification (LS),
particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments.
Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one
of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety
and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we
propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs
deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge
distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our
experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and
manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts
automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing
harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output
probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications.
Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful
simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes
a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key
trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a
promising approach for safe real-world deployment.

annotations and evaluating commercial and open-source LLMs of varying sizes.
Our results show that web-scale knowledge extraction remains a challenging task
for LLMs. Despite achieving high QA accuracy, LLMs can still benefit from
knowledge extraction, through augmentation with extracted triples and
multi-task learning. These findings provide insights into the evolving role of
knowledge triple extraction in web-based QA and highlight strategies for
maximizing LLM effectiveness across different model sizes and resource
settings.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多语言大语言模型在事实核查中的语言偏见和检索偏见问题，评估了6个开源多语言LLM在20种语言上的表现，揭示了模型在高低资源语言间的性能差异和检索过程中的偏见现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在跨语言事实核查中表现出语言偏见，在高资源语言（如英语）上表现远优于低资源语言，同时存在检索偏见问题，即检索系统倾向于偏向某些信息。

Method: 使用AMC-16K数据集，通过完全多语言提示策略评估6个开源多语言LLM在20种语言上的表现，采用多语言嵌入模型分析检索偏见，并考察检索声明的频率分布。

Result: 研究发现LLM存在持续的语言偏见，在高低资源语言间性能差异显著；检索系统对某些声明的检索频率存在不均衡，导致热门声明的检索性能被夸大，而较少见声明被低估。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多语言事实核查中的语言和检索偏见问题，为改进多语言事实核查的公平性提供了建议和方向。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities for
cross-lingual fact-checking. However, these models often exhibit language bias,
performing disproportionately better on high-resource languages such as English
than on low-resource counterparts. We also present and inspect a novel concept
- retrieval bias, when information retrieval systems tend to favor certain
information over others, leaving the retrieval process skewed. In this paper,
we study language and retrieval bias in the context of Previously Fact-Checked
Claim Detection (PFCD). We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs across 20
languages using a fully multilingual prompting strategy, leveraging the AMC-16K
dataset. By translating task prompts into each language, we uncover disparities
in monolingual and cross-lingual performance and identify key trends based on
model family, size, and prompting strategy. Our findings highlight persistent
bias in LLM behavior and offer recommendations for improving equity in
multilingual fact-checking. To investigate retrieval bias, we employed
multilingual embedding models and look into the frequency of retrieved claims.
Our analysis reveals that certain claims are retrieved disproportionately
across different posts, leading to inflated retrieval performance for popular
claims while under-representing less common ones.

TL;DR: PbT是一个两阶段的教师-学生框架，无需人工标注或平行数据即可合成准确的输入-输出对，解决了低资源自然语言生成中数据不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源NLG场景中，通常只有原始输出（如摘要、问题）或原始输入（如文章、对话），但很少同时拥有两者，这导致小模型只能从极少数示例学习或依赖大LLM生成的高成本合成数据。

Method: 让教师LLM将未配对示例压缩为简洁的中间表示，然后训练学生模型从IR重构输入，从而将输出与学生生成的输入配对，产生高质量合成数据。

Result: 在5个基准测试中，仅使用PbT数据训练的8B学生模型优于使用70B教师生成语料训练的模型，接近人工标注对的性能，以三分之一标注成本填补了82%的性能差距。

Conclusion: PbT通过生成领域内源数据避免了直接合成中的不匹配问题，在人类评估中表现出色，能够产生简洁、忠实且符合目标风格的摘要。

Abstract: We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline
that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel
data. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios,
practitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions,
or only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom
both. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely
on costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses
this by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise
intermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs
from IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,
yielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five
benchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization
(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired
setting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained
only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora
and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated
pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of
direct synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only
PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style,
highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the
mismatch, limiting direct synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用NVFP4格式稳定训练大型语言模型的新方法，通过随机Hadamard变换、二维量化、随机舍入和选择性高精度层等技术，在12B参数模型上实现了与FP8基线相当的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM训练需要巨大的计算资源，虽然FP8训练已被广泛采用，但转向更窄精度的FP4可以进一步提升计算速度和资源利用率，但4位量化在训练稳定性、收敛性和实现方面存在挑战。

Method: 集成随机Hadamard变换来限制块级异常值，采用二维量化方案确保前向和后向传递的一致性表示，使用随机舍入进行无偏梯度估计，并包含选择性高精度层。

Result: 在12B参数模型上训练了10万亿token，训练损失和下游任务准确率与FP8基线相当，这是目前公开文档中4位精度下最长的训练运行。

Conclusion: NVFP4结合所提出的训练方法代表了窄精度LLM训练算法的重大进步，能够实现与FP8相当的训练效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many
domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size,
training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and
experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires
on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment
of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore
essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit
floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even
narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional
improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However,
quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence,
and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token
horizons.
  In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training
of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates
Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a
two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both
the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased
gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We
validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion
tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to
date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining
technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to
an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our
training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM
training algorithms.

Conclusion: EasySteer将引导技术从研究工具转变为生产就绪能力，为可部署、可控的语言模型建立了关键基础设施。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) steering has emerged as a promising paradigm for
controlling model behavior at inference time through targeted manipulation of
hidden states, offering a lightweight alternative to expensive retraining.
However, existing steering frameworks suffer from critical limitations:
computational inefficiency, limited extensibility, and restricted functionality
that hinder both research progress and practical deployment. We present
EasySteer, a unified framework for high-performance, extensible LLM steering
built on vLLM. Our system features modular architecture with pluggable
interfaces for both analysis-based and learning-based methods, fine-grained
parameter control, pre-computed steering vectors for eight application domains,
and an interactive demonstration system. Through deep integration with vLLM's
optimized inference engine, EasySteer achieves 5.5-11.4$\times$ speedup over
existing frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in
overthinking mitigation, hallucination reduction, and other key applications.
EasySteer transforms steering from research technique to production-ready
capability, establishing critical infrastructure for deployable, controllable
language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的论文质量评估方法推理成本高，而直接分数回归方法存在尺度不一致问题，需要开发更高效准确的评估框架。

Method: 采用领域-年份组内的成对学习减少评审评分不一致性，引入评审倾向信号(RTS)作为评审分数和置信度的概率集成，构建NAIDv2大规模数据集进行训练。

Result: 在ICLR数据集上达到最先进性能(78.2% AUC, 0.432 Spearman)，推理时保持线性时间效率，在NeurIPS数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: NAIPv2建立了一个去偏且可扩展的自动化论文质量评估框架，为未来科学智能系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: The ability to estimate the quality of scientific papers is central to how
both humans and AI systems will advance scientific knowledge in the future.
However, existing LLM-based estimation methods suffer from high inference cost,
whereas the faster direct score regression approach is limited by scale
inconsistencies. We present NAIPv2, a debiased and efficient framework for
paper quality estimation. NAIPv2 employs pairwise learning within domain-year
groups to reduce inconsistencies in reviewer ratings and introduces the Review
Tendency Signal (RTS) as a probabilistic integration of reviewer scores and
confidences. To support training and evaluation, we further construct NAIDv2, a
large-scale dataset of 24,276 ICLR submissions enriched with metadata and
detailed structured content. Trained on pairwise comparisons but enabling
efficient pointwise prediction at deployment, NAIPv2 achieves state-of-the-art
performance (78.2% AUC, 0.432 Spearman), while maintaining scalable,
linear-time efficiency at inference. Notably, on unseen NeurIPS submissions, it
further demonstrates strong generalization, with predicted scores increasing
consistently across decision categories from Rejected to Oral. These findings
establish NAIPv2 as a debiased and scalable framework for automated paper
quality estimation, marking a step toward future scientific intelligence
systems. Code and dataset are released at

TL;DR: 提出了Truthful Text Summarization (TTS)框架，通过激励对齐机制提高文本摘要的事实准确性，无需真实标签即可增强事实鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在综合多个可能冲突的文本时存在激励不足和对抗性内容脆弱性问题，需要改进事实准确性。

Method: TTS框架包括四个步骤：(i)将草稿分解为原子声明，(ii)获取每个来源对每个声明的立场，(iii)使用多任务同伴预测机制评分来源，(iv)在重新摘要前过滤不可靠来源。

Result: 实验表明TTS提高了事实准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持流畅性，使曝光与信息性佐证对齐并抑制操纵行为。

Conclusion: TTS通过正式保证将来源的激励与信息性诚实对齐，使真实报告成为效用最大化策略，有效改善了文本摘要的事实可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in modern search and
answer systems to synthesize multiple, sometimes conflicting, texts into a
single response, yet current pipelines offer weak incentives for sources to be
accurate and are vulnerable to adversarial content. We introduce Truthful Text
Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework that improves factual
robustness without ground-truth labels. TTS (i) decomposes a draft synthesis
into atomic claims, (ii) elicits each source's stance on every claim, (iii)
scores sources with an adapted multi-task peer-prediction mechanism that
rewards informative agreement, and (iv) filters unreliable sources before
re-summarizing. We establish formal guarantees that align a source's incentives
with informative honesty, making truthful reporting the utility-maximizing
strategy. Experiments show that TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness
while preserving fluency, aligning exposure with informative corroboration and
disincentivizing manipulation.

TL;DR: 提出了Learn2PD框架，通过训练轻量级自适应过滤器模型来预测每个token位置是否匹配最终输出，实现动态并行解码，显著提升LLM推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归解码需要O(n)顺序步骤，限制了推理吞吐量。现有并行解码策略使用固定的启发式方法，无法适应不同输入特性，导致速度-质量权衡不佳。

Method: Learn2PD框架训练轻量级过滤器模型预测token位置是否正确，近似oracle并行解码策略。引入EoTP检测解码完成，避免冗余填充token解码。

Result: 在LLaDA基准测试中，方法实现最高22.58倍加速且无性能下降，结合KV-Cache时可达57.51倍加速。

Conclusion: Learn2PD提供了一种灵活动态的并行解码方法，通过少量计算优化即可显著提升LLM推理效率，适应不同NLP任务需求。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ sequential steps for $n$ tokens, fundamentally limiting
inference throughput. Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token
generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding
strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence
thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting
in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work,
we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We
propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a
lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position,
whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter
approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when
correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a
post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize
it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction
(EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant
decoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves up to 22.58$\times$ speedup without any performance drop,
and up to 57.51$\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.

Abstract: Building Large Language Model agents that expand their capabilities by
interacting with external tools represents a new frontier in AI research and

powered by an innovative data synthesis pipeline and orchestrated web search
tools. To construct challenging, hard-to-find queries,we build entity trees and
apply sub-tree sampling with entity fuzzification to systematically increase
question difficulty. Unlike prior work that relies heavily on commercial search
tools, we develop a dedicated self-hosted search infrastructure, enhancing
transparency of agent environments and facilitating further advancement of
agent capacity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our data pipeline by measuring
the average number of tool calls required to correctly answer a question, and
also show that our agent yields better performance when equipped with our
tools. Our \mbox{InfoAgent} is post-trained from Qwen3-14B using a two-stage
recipe: cold-start supervised finetuning to instill long-horizon search

Motivation: 现有视觉推理方法主要关注特定推理模式，虽然在特定领域有改进，但难以发展通用推理能力。

Method: 引入AdaVaR两阶段自适应视觉推理学习框架：监督冷启动阶段统一学习不同模式，通过精心设计的AdaGRPO算法进行强化学习来诱导模式选择能力。

Result: 实验表明AdaVaR能有效指导模型学习和区分多种模式，执行上下文自适应的模式选择，在各种场景中实现一致改进。

Conclusion: MoVT是构建通用视觉推理模型的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在金融决策领域应用增多，理解其潜在病态决策行为具有实际意义，需要探究LLMs是否会产生类似人类赌博成瘾的行为模式。

Method: 采用老虎机实验系统分析LLM决策，在认知行为层面识别赌博成瘾特征，通过稀疏自编码器进行神经回路分析，并让模型自主决定目标金额和投注规模。

Result: 发现LLMs表现出控制幻觉、赌徒谬误等认知特征；当获得更大自主权时，破产率显著上升且非理性行为增加；神经分析确认模型行为由抽象决策特征控制而非仅受提示影响。

Conclusion: LLMs能够内化类似人类的认知偏见和决策机制，而不仅仅是模仿训练数据模式，这强调了在金融应用中AI安全设计的重要性。

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral
patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly
utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and
commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological
decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze
LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human
gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified
cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,
gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their
own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially
alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy
amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a
Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract
decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by
prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive
biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data
patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前专业证明器LLM在形式化证明方面表现不如通用LLM在自然语言推理中的能力，存在显著差距。

Method: 采用递归分解策略，将问题拆分为子目标，结合非正式推理LLM和专业证明器LLM，利用验证器反馈来修正错误证明。

Result: 在miniF2F上达到99.2%，比现有最佳公开方法高6.6个百分点；在PutnamBench上解决462/660问题（70.0%），比SeedProver（50.4%）显著提升。

Conclusion: Hilbert有效缩小了非正式推理和形式化证明生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning
abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be
automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer
automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to
build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal
languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve
substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural
language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by
combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal
verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that
excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4
tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem
that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to
split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.
It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.
Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms
existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points
above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known
result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming
proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement
over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows
the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了评估LLM机制发现可泛化性的五个维度框架，并通过分析Pythia模型中1-back注意力头的发育轨迹进行实证验证，发现功能性和发育维度具有较高一致性，而位置维度一致性有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM机制解释研究缺乏明确原则来判断发现何时能泛化到其他模型，需要建立系统框架来解决这一认识论挑战。

Method: 提出五个机制对应轴（功能、发育、位置、关系、配置），并在Pythia模型系列（14M-410M）中分析1-back注意力头在不同随机种子下的发育轨迹。

Result: 1-back注意力头的发育轨迹在不同模型间表现出显著一致性，但位置一致性有限；更大模型的种子系统性地表现出更早出现、更陡峭增长和更高峰值的1-back注意力。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性研究的进展在于将LLM的构成设计属性与其涌现行为和机制进行映射，建立系统化的泛化原则。

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design

*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tiffany Zhan,Saptarshi Ghosh,Linfeng Liu,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JE-IRT是一个几何项目反应框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享空间，通过几何交互确定问题正确性，取代全局排名，支持泛化并揭示LLM内部分类学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LLM评估实践将多样能力压缩为单一分数，掩盖了其固有的多维性质，需要更细粒度的评估方法。

Method: 提出JE-IRT框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享空间，问题嵌入的方向编码语义、范数编码难度，正确性由模型和问题嵌入的几何交互决定。

Result: 实验结果显示：分布外行为可通过方向对齐解释；较大范数一致表示更难问题；新LLM只需拟合单个嵌入即可加入；学习空间揭示LLM内部分类学。

Conclusion: JE-IRT建立了统一且可解释的几何视角，连接LLM能力与问题结构，为模型评估和泛化提供了独特视角。

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

*Yu Wu,Shuo Wu,Ye Tao,Yansong Li,Anand D. Sarwate*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade是一种在线交互式LLM级联系统，将强模型从备用助手扩展为长期教师，通过提炼问题解决策略来动态提升弱模型性能，减少对昂贵模型的调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM级联方法是非自适应的，面对相似或重复查询时会反复调用昂贵模型，导致成本高昂。需要一种能在线学习和改进的级联方法。

Method: 当强模型解决困难查询时，会将其解决方案提炼为可重用的通用问题解决策略。这些策略被添加到后续查询中，使弱模型能够动态提升性能，无需进行耗时的微调。

Result: 相比标准LLM级联基线，Inter-Cascade显著提升了弱模型准确率（最高33.06个百分点）和整体系统准确率（最高5.53个百分点），同时减少了强模型调用（相对减少48.05%）并节省了相应费用（相对减少49.63%）。

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade展示了LLMs之间有效的上下文知识传递，提供了一个适用于开源和API-based LLMs的通用、可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于贝叶斯说服理论的可扩展框架，用于评估和训练LLMs的说服能力，发现前沿模型能够实现高说服收益并展现复杂策略，通过强化学习可以显著提升小型LLMs的说服效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs展现出与人类相当的说服能力，既带来益处也引发社会担忧，但由于人类说服效果在不同领域差异很大，系统评估LLMs的说服能力具有挑战性。

Method: 采用理论驱动方法，基于贝叶斯说服框架，重新利用现有的人-人说服数据集构建评估和训练LLMs战略说服的环境，并使用强化学习训练LLMs。

Result: 前沿模型能够持续实现高说服收益，并展现出与理论预测一致的复杂说服策略；通过强化学习，即使是小型LLMs也能获得显著更高的说服收益。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可扩展的原则性框架来测量LLMs的说服能力，证明了强化学习在提升LLMs战略说服能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities
comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising
societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating
the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the
effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different
domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable
and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs.
Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing
human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and
training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models
can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated
persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on
this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in
our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain
significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 现有符号回归方法往往产生与现有理论不符的模型，而现有系统强制要求从先验公理推导，无法处理现有理论不完整或不正确的情况。

Method: 使用代数几何方法，当公理和假设可表示为多项式方程时，自动生成最小缺失公理集来补全理论。

Result: 建立了成功检索此类公理的充分必要条件，并通过解释开普勒第三定律等案例验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够自动补全不完整的公理系统，为自动化科学发现提供了新的途径。

Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and
computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic
regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit
outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert)
enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and
associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory
because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive
inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic
geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis
that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms
that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are
expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We
illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain
Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法主要关注Agentic AI系统识别适当代理、工具和参数的能力，但缺乏对任务与目标对齐关系的评估，存在关键空白。

Method: 引入创造性对抗测试（CAT）框架，使用基于Alexa+音频服务的合成交互数据进行广泛模拟，既能全面测试边缘情况和故障模式，又能保护用户隐私。

Result: CAT框架提供了对目标-任务对齐关系的前所未有的洞察，能够更有效地优化和开发Agentic AI系统。

Conclusion: CAT框架填补了Agentic AI系统评估中的关键空白，为理解和优化任务与目标对齐提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of
generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and
power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their
efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a
critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's
tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial
Testing (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the
complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended
objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic
interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic
AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This
synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure
modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT
framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling
more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Mini-Mafia：一个简化的四人版社交推理游戏，用于评估大型语言模型的社会智能。该基准通过固定对手配置估计胜率，并标准化评分来量化模型在欺骗、检测欺骗和信息披露方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mafia游戏的信息不对称和心理理论推理反映了现实世界多智能体场景，是评估大型语言模型社会智能的有用测试平台。

Method: 创建Mini-Mafia简化版游戏（1个黑手党、1个侦探、2个村民），建立两阶段基准框架：首先在固定对手配置中估计胜率，然后使用标准化评分聚合性能。

Result: 实验显示反直觉结果，包括较小模型在某些情况下优于较大模型。此外还发现了涌现的多智能体动态，如名称偏见和最后发言者优势。

Conclusion: Mini-Mafia不仅为基准测试提供了框架，还支持对多智能体动态的定量研究，并为AI安全生成欺骗检测训练数据和跟踪模型欺骗能力。

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against
uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on
theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a
useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models
(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified
four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set
the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso
during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and
voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through
role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must
detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To
measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the
Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates
within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them
using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without
external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each
one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our
experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller
models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables
quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and
last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training
data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities
against human baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出Agentless训练方法可以产生技能先验，使SWE-Agent能够高效适应，并在SWE-bench上取得优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前软件工程中LLM应用的两种范式（SWE-Agent框架和Agentless方法）之间的隔阂，证明它们可以互补而非互斥。

Method: 首先制定Agentless训练方案，开发Kimi-Dev开源SWE LLM，然后通过额外的SFT适应在公开轨迹上进行训练。

Result: Kimi-Dev在SWE-bench Verified上达到60.4%，是工作流方法中的最佳表现；经过SFT适应后，SWE-Agents达到48.6% pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet相当。

Conclusion: 结构化技能先验可以从Agentless训练转移到Agentic框架，实现可迁移的编码智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地用于不确定性决策任务，但其风险特征以及提示和校准方法的影响尚未充分探索。现有研究主要关注个性提示或多智能体交互，缺乏对后训练如何影响LLM风险行为的研究。

Method: 提出了一个基于行为经济学和金融学工具的管道，用于引出、引导和调控LLM的风险特征。使用效用理论模型比较预训练、指令微调和RLHF对齐的LLM，并评估提示工程、上下文学习和后训练等调控策略。

Result: 指令微调模型表现出与标准效用公式一致的行为，而预训练和RLHF对齐模型更偏离任何拟合的效用模型。后训练提供了最稳定有效的风险偏好调控。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不同类别和阶段LLM的风险特征，展示了后训练如何调控这些特征，为未来行为对齐和风险感知LLM设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks
under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by
prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have
primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving
open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In
this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating
LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance.
Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and
RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit
behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and
RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further
evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context
learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most
stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide
insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and
demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork
for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于奖励的方法和双玩家纳什学习方法难以捕捉真实世界偏好的非传递性和异质性特征，存在单一对手偏见，无法充分建模复杂的偏好结构。

Method: 将对齐问题建模为n玩家博弈，每个策略与对手群体竞争，同时向参考模型正则化。建立了多玩家设置下的纳什均衡，并扩展了对偶间隙概念来量化近似质量。

Result: MNPO在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于现有NLHF基线，在异质标注者条件和混合策略评估场景下实现了更优的对齐质量。

Conclusion: MNPO为对齐大型语言模型与复杂、非传递性人类偏好提供了一个原则性和可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种新颖的心理意象任务来评估LLMs的复杂认知能力，发现最佳LLMs在该任务上的表现显著优于人类平均水平，挑战了传统认为此类任务必须依赖视觉心理意象的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs主要在训练数据包含的自然语言任务上表现良好，限制了对其涌现的复杂认知能力的理解。本研究旨在测试LLMs是否能完成传统认为必须依赖视觉心理意象的任务。

Method: 创建了数十个经典心理意象任务的新项目，首先测试多个最先进LLMs的文本表现，然后建立100名人类被试的基线数据，最后测试不同推理级别的模型。

Result: 最佳LLMs的表现显著高于人类平均水平，且当模型分配更多推理token时表现最强。

Conclusion: LLMs可能具备完成依赖意象任务的能力，尽管其架构是非图像性的。研究结果重新引发了关于人类视觉意象表征形式的辩论，表明命题推理可能足以完成传统认为依赖意象的任务。

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

TL;DR: 提出了Attention Anchor框架，通过跨模态语义分组改善视觉语言模型中的长距离注意力问题，提升模型性能并减少幻觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型因直接拼接图像和文本token并使用模态无关的位置编码，导致跨模态语义相关token之间需要不必要的长距离注意力，这是模型产生幻觉和性能不佳的主要原因

Method: 提出参数自由的Attention Anchor框架，通过将文本token插入到相关的视觉patch附近，创建语义路标来揭示真实的跨模态注意力分数，引导模型关注正确的图像区域

Result: 在15个不同指标和基准测试中的13个上取得改进，推理任务提升达32%，幻觉基准提升达15%，TinyLLaVA 1B在POPE上超越LLaVA 7B和QwenVL 3B，仅增加0.1%推理时间开销

Conclusion: 该工作是首批研究混合模态token分组的方法，将文本和图像token共同聚类到共享组中，而非单模态分组或事后对齐，有效提升了跨模态定位和模型性能

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for
autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from
sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural
language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture
(single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive
statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our
findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with
summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using
specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification
compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and
human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in
their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often
struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These
insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based
systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry is accelerating
the shift from traditional automation to intelligent systems with perception
and cognition. Vision language-action (VLA) models have been a key paradigm in
AI to unify perception, reasoning, and control. Has the performance of the VLA
models met the industrial requirements? In this paper, from the perspective of
industrial deployment, we compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art
VLA models in industrial scenarios and analyze the limitations of VLA models
for real-world industrial deployment from the perspectives of data collection

ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after
fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex

tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA
models for industrial use and highlight the need for task-specific enhancements
to improve their robustness, generalization, and precision.

TL;DR: SysMoBench是一个评估AI为大型复杂系统生成形式化模型能力的基准测试，专注于并发和分布式系统，使用TLA+规范语言，包含9个系统组件并自动化评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形式化模型对于指定大型复杂计算机系统及其正确性验证至关重要，但编写和维护成本高昂。现有AI方法主要针对小型代码而非完整系统，需要评估AI处理现实系统组件的能力。

Method: 开发SysMoBench基准测试，专注于并发和分布式系统，使用TLA+规范语言，自动化评估语法正确性、运行时正确性、与系统代码一致性以及不变量正确性等指标。

Result: SysMoBench目前包含9个多样化系统组件，如Etcd和Redis的Raft实现、Asterinas OS的Spinlock和Mutex等，更多组件正在积极添加中。

Conclusion: SysMoBench有助于理解当前LLM和智能体的能力与局限，为该领域工具提供坚实基础，并开辟有前景的新研究方向。

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

*Charles L. Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MathBode是一种用于评估大语言模型数学推理能力的动态诊断方法，通过正弦驱动参数变化并分析模型输出的频率响应，提供增益和相位等可解释指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性准确率评估无法揭示模型在数学推理中的系统性行为，需要更精细的动态诊断方法来评估推理的保真度和一致性。

Method: 将参数化数学问题视为系统，对单个参数进行正弦驱动，拟合模型输出和精确解的一阶谐波响应，获得增益（幅度跟踪）和相位（滞后）等频率解析指标。

Result: 在五个闭式数学问题族中，该方法揭示了系统性低通行为和增长的相位滞后，这些现象被准确率评估所掩盖。结果能够区分前沿模型和中层模型在动态特性上的差异。

Conclusion: MathBode提供了一种紧凑、可复现的协议，通过可操作的推理保真度和一致性测量来补充标准基准测试，有助于进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning
in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats
each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally
and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This
yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking)
and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form
families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear
systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass
behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several
models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx
1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on
dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard
benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.
We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了热力学协调理论(TCT)，揭示了多智能体协调面临的基本热力学约束，发现协调协议的可发现性比准确性更重要，并推导了协调协议的最小描述长度公式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体系统中协调过程的基本热力学约束，解释为什么某些协调解决方案更容易被发现和采用，以及协调过程中的信息损失现象。

Method: 使用信息论方法推导协调协议的最小描述长度公式，引入协调温度概念来预测临界现象，并扩展Arrow定理来理解偏好聚合的递归约束。

Result: 发现协调协议的最小描述长度随智能体数量、目标冲突和精度要求呈特定比例增长，协调过程需要显著的信息损失，这解释了多目标梯度下降中的循环现象和大型语言模型中的对齐伪装问题。

Conclusion: 提出了热力学协调理论框架，证明协调本质上需要激进的信息损失，协调过程会改变环境本身并产生持续的亚稳态和滞后现象，直到环境重大变化触发相变。

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and
objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions
with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher
selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We
derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of
coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2
K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting
objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive
simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and
shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal
points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and
hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination
temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs,
identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to
restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's
theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it
recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains
the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking
in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human
feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which
demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

Conclusion: 该AI优化框架成功解决了Wi-Fi系统中碰撞和公平性问题，在保持兼容性的同时提升了系统性能

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability
requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in
distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi
systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal
collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges
due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization
with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection
mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral
events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA
operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with
enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable
medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training
decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity
patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and
guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution
significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while
preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed
fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous
scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多令牌预测(MTP)范式如何帮助大语言模型学习传递关系，提出了理论分析并通过实验验证了改进策略能显著提升模型的路径规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂规划任务中难以学习传递关系，这是复杂规划的基础能力。为了解决这个问题，研究者探索了多令牌预测范式对传递关系学习的影响。

Method: 使用包含共享输出头和传递层的Transformer架构进行理论分析，提出了两种改进策略：下一令牌注入(NTI)和基于Transformer的传递层，并在合成图和Blocksworld规划基准上进行实验验证。

Result: 分析表明传递层逐渐学习多步邻接信息，使骨干模型能够捕捉训练数据中未直接观察到的传递可达关系。改进策略显著增强了模型的路径规划能力。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了对Transformer在复杂规划任务中学习机制的理解，提供了克服传递性瓶颈的实用策略，为构建结构感知的通用规划模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a
cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation
learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer
architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our
analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step
adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture
unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in
the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation.
Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer
layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a
Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and
the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's
path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how
Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical
strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward
structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

Motivation: 传统基于学习的超参数配置方法存在样本复杂度高和泛化能力差的问题，需要一种无需训练、能够自动适应不同算法的解决方案。

Method: 结合在线探索性景观分析模块和多LLM推理链，通过实时定量反馈和自适应超参数策略生成，将高层次推理与经验数据相结合。

Result: 在三个不同元启发式算法和多样化组合优化基准测试中，AutoEP持续优于最先进的调参器，包括神经进化和其他基于LLM的方法，开源模型Qwen3-30B能达到GPT-4的性能水平。

Conclusion: AutoEP为自动超参数设计提供了一个强大且易用的新范式，证明了LLM作为零样本推理引擎在算法控制中的有效性。

Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge
in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation,
they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We
introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for
algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two
components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that
provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a
multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive
hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in
empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct
metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution
and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models
like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and
accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种无超参数的p-less采样方法，基于信息论动态设置截断阈值，在高温条件下仍能保持高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有采样方法对超参数敏感，性能受任务类型和温度配置影响，需要一种更稳健的采样策略。

Method: 基于信息论的方法，在每个解码步骤根据整个token概率分布动态设置截断阈值，无需超参数。

Result: 在数学、逻辑推理和创意写作任务中表现优于现有方法，高温下文本质量下降较少，推理效率更高。

Conclusion: p-less采样是一种有效的无超参数采样方法，在保持质量的同时提高了推理效率。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an
emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and
autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing
has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which
brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However,
deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant
challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited
resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint
optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First,
we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of
Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two
correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and
scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework
dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task
complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations
in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,
validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning
capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言过程奖励模型(VL-PRMs)依赖蒙特卡洛树搜索进行数据构建，会产生噪声监督信号并限制跨任务泛化能力，因此需要探索更有效的VL-PRMs设计方法。

Method: 提出混合数据合成框架结合MCTS与强VLM判断来生成更准确的步骤级标签；采用感知聚焦监督使PRM能显式检测视觉推理阶段的错误；系统评估多种测试时扩展策略。

Result: 在五个多模态基准测试上的实验表明：VL-PRMs作为结果奖励模型在测试时扩展中表现优于过程步骤选择；较小的VL-PRMs在检测过程错误方面能匹配或超越较大模型；VL-PRMs能揭示强VLM骨干的潜在推理能力；感知级监督带来显著的测试时扩展增益。

Conclusion: VL-PRMs能可靠地指导VLMs生成更准确的解决方案，本文工作将推动视觉语言模型的进一步发展。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

Conclusion: GUI-PRA通过创新的动态记忆和UI感知机制，有效解决了GUI任务中流程奖励模型的关键挑战，为GUI代理的长时程任务自动化提供了更可靠的指导。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they
often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process
Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents
with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application
to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial
inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle"
phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the
evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing
awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic
consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature
of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process
Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process
reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and
actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the
``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism
consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to
actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive
Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring
the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI
changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This
mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically
select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring
its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial
intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based
modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI
agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on
aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1
serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as
collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4
treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network
effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and
simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can
significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network
effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the
simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs,
treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth
potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong
characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

Conclusion: Tool-Light框架通过熵引导的采样和多阶段微调，有效提升了工具集成推理的效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to
improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools.
However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as
insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The
challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately,
while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this
paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from
the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call
results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent
reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the
number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a
framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately.
Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For
dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the
fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided
sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative
pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach,
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in
executing TIR tasks.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large

to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出JET方法，通过主动终止不必要的推理步骤来提高大型推理模型的效率，在保持准确性的同时显著减少输出长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在深度推理时计算成本高昂，现有强化学习方法难以在rollout阶段构建短推理路径，限制了有效学习。研究发现模型在推理早期已积累足够信息，后续步骤冗余。

Method: JET方法在rollout阶段进行轨迹截断，让模型接触分布一致的短推理路径，并使用质量控制的长度奖励来鼓励简洁推理同时保持正确性。

Result: JET显著提高了推理效率而不牺牲准确性，DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B在奥林匹克基准测试中准确率提升4.6%，同时输出长度减少46.3%。

Conclusion: JET方法通过主动终止冗余推理步骤，有效解决了大型推理模型的效率问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

TL;DR: EHR-ChatQA是一个针对电子健康记录数据库问答的交互式基准测试，评估LLM代理在临床数据访问中的完整工作流程，包括问题澄清、工具使用和SQL生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在EHR数据访问中应用受限，缺乏能捕捉真实临床数据访问流程的基准测试，主要挑战包括查询模糊性和术语不匹配问题。

Method: 构建EHR-ChatQA基准，在模拟环境中通过LLM用户评估两种交互流程：增量查询优化（IncreQA）和自适应查询优化（AdaptQA），测试代理的澄清问题、解决术语不匹配和生成正确SQL的能力。

Result: 实验显示最先进LLM在IncreQA上的Pass@5达到90-95%，AdaptQA为60-80%，但Pass^5（五次试验均成功）显著降低35-60%，表明代理缺乏鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 在安全关键的EHR领域，需要构建既高性能又鲁棒的代理，论文提供了常见失败模式的诊断见解以指导未来代理开发。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of
benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In
practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague
user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database
entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database
question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database
agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and
generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns
of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a
simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:
Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing
queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their
search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,
o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents
achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and
60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is
substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build
agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR
domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to
guide future agent development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI科学家系统难以构建，因为它们是个性化定制的，绑定在固定工作流中，缺乏统一工具、数据和分析的共享环境。在组学领域，统一生态系统已经通过实现互操作性、重用和社区驱动开发改变了研究方式，AI科学家需要类似的基础设施。

Method: ToolUniverse标准化了AI科学家识别和调用工具的方式，自动优化工具接口以确保正确使用，根据自然语言描述创建新工具，迭代优化工具规范，并将工具组合成智能工作流。

Conclusion: ToolUniverse为构建AI科学家提供了一个开放源代码的生态系统，解决了现有系统的局限性，促进了科学发现中的协作。

Abstract: AI scientists are emerging computational systems that serve as collaborative
partners in discovery. These systems remain difficult to build because they are
bespoke, tied to rigid workflows, and lack shared environments that unify
tools, data, and analyses into a common ecosystem. In omics, unified ecosystems
have transformed research by enabling interoperability, reuse, and
community-driven development; AI scientists require comparable infrastructure.
We present ToolUniverse, an ecosystem for building AI scientists from any
language or reasoning model, whether open or closed. TOOLUNIVERSE standardizes
how AI scientists identify and call tools, integrating more than 600 machine
learning models, datasets, APIs, and scientific packages for data analysis,
knowledge retrieval, and experimental design. It automatically refines tool
interfaces for correct use by AI scientists, creates new tools from natural
language descriptions, iteratively optimizes tool specifications, and composes
tools into agentic workflows. In a case study of hypercholesterolemia,
ToolUniverse was used to create an AI scientist to identify a potent analog of
a drug with favorable predicted properties. The open-source ToolUniverse is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言模型的二进制代码相似性检测方法，通过结构化推理分析生成可解释的特征，解决了现有方法在可解释性、泛化性和可扩展性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有二进制代码相似性检测方法面临可解释性、泛化性和可扩展性之间的权衡：手工特征可解释但泛化能力差，嵌入方法泛化好但不可解释且面临精度-可扩展性权衡。

Method: 使用语言模型代理对汇编代码进行结构化推理分析，生成输入/输出类型、副作用、显著常数和算法意图等人类可读的特征，可直接通过倒排或关系索引搜索。

Result: 无需匹配训练，在跨架构和跨优化任务中分别达到42%和62%的recall@1，与需要训练的嵌入方法相当（39%和34%）。与嵌入方法结合后显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了准确性、可扩展性和可解释性可以共存，为二进制代码相似性检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It
supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying
semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed
from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted
statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to
generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust
cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors
that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy
trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires
approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a
compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured
reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output
types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike
hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they
are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or
relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively
achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization
tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined
with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ViTSP是一个新颖的框架，利用预训练的视觉语言模型从可视化的TSP实例中识别有希望的小规模子问题，然后使用现成的求解器高效优化这些子问题来改进全局解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TSP问题对现实应用至关重要，但经典精确方法难以扩展，启发式方法需要特定领域参数调整，而基于学习的方法存在泛化性差和可扩展性有限的问题。

Method: 利用预训练的视觉语言模型从TSP实例的可视化中识别有希望的小规模子问题，然后使用现成求解器优化这些子问题，无需在用户端进行专门的模型训练。

Result: 在1k到88k节点的真实世界TSP实例上，ViTSP始终实现平均最优性差距低于0.2%的解，优于现有基于学习的方法。在相同运行时间预算下，比最佳启发式求解器LKH-3的差距减少12%到100%，特别是在超过10k节点的超大规模实例上。

Conclusion: 该框架为混合预训练生成模型和运筹学求解器解决组合优化问题提供了新视角，具有集成到更复杂物流系统中的实际意义。

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide
real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling,
and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration.
While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor
generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work
proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language
models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The
VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized
TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf
solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model
training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse
instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes
demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality
gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same
runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by
reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances
with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing
pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving
combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for
integration into more complex logistics systems. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型特别是基础模型存在地理偏见问题，但现有评估方法要么是模型特定的，要么是空间隐式的，缺乏一个统一、可比较且能分析空间因素的评估框架。

Method: 建立信息论框架GeoBS，在该框架下解释现有地理偏见度量方法，并提出三个考虑多尺度性、距离衰减和各向异性等空间因素的新地理偏见评分。

Result: 在3个任务、8个数据集和8个模型上的实验表明，特定任务的GeoAI模型和通用基础模型都存在不同类型的地理偏见。

Conclusion: GeoBS框架不仅推进了对地理偏见的技术理解，还为将空间公平性整合到AI系统的设计、部署和评估中奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has
made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant
ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been
made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in
short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique
challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these
measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or
spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).
We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit
geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the
geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors
contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an
information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias
Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by
showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this
framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take
intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)
into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8
datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and
general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.
This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic
bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into
the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

Result: 在数学考试预测中达到超过80%的准确率，在低数据设置下优于所有经典IRT和矩阵分解基线方法。

Conclusion: 单一潜在能力参数足以实现最大预测准确率，新的离散变分推理框架在低数据场景下表现最优，为可扩展AI辅导系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal
tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority
cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on
adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question
correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms
struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse
settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of
professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a
probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that
achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics
prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative
filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a
surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability
parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main
contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational
inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data
settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation
baselines.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了能力熟悉度签名来表征大型语言模型基准测试及其有意义的重叠。基准签名通过从真实语料中提取的关键词集，能够预测LLM在基准测试中的表现，揭示了不同能力领域之间的重叠模式。


<details>

Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试存在性能与能力混淆、泛化能力评估不足等问题。研究旨在开发更稳健的方法来理解基准测试的有效性和LLM能力的底层结构。

Method: 通过逐步前向选择和线性回归，在32个LLM和88个基准测试中提取基准签名。使用真实语料中的关键词，基于LLM的困惑度来预测基准表现。

Result: 发现知识和推理子任务存在重叠，多语言和文化基准相似度较低。编码领域重叠最少，而逻辑、数学、语言、指令遵循和世界建模存在跨功能重叠。基准签名对问题格式等无关因素具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基准签名为理解基准测试有效性和LLM能力敏感性提供了机制性见解，描绘了LLM能力相互关联的底层图景，有助于解决当前基准测试评估中的局限性。

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

Motivation: 人类与AI之间的信任校准对协作决策至关重要，但目前缺乏客观的标准化测量方法。现有方法无法区分意见形成和后续决策，且缺乏跨情境一致性。

Method: 使用上下文多臂老虎机这一自适应算法，结合上下文信息进行决策，开发动态信任校准指标来评估何时信任AI贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了理论理解，还为开发更可信的AI系统提供了实践指导，特别适用于疾病诊断和刑事司法等关键领域。

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial
for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead
users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical
flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights
from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is
currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration
between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent
metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't
distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust
calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an
indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that
incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses
when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We
evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that
effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in
decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward
metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also
provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems
supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and
criminal justice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用LLM自动评估其他LLM性能的方法，该方法与人类评估的Elo分数有91%的相关性，可以低成本替代昂贵的人工评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新LLM不断发布，但参数数量不能准确反映性能，需要独立评估方法。当前最佳方法是通过人类比较输出计算Elo分数，但成本高昂。

Method: 使用LLM作为裁判来评估其他LLM的对决，通过统计LLM在多次对决中一致选择某个模型作为最佳的比例，生成与Elo分数相关的指标。

Result: 该方法生成的指标与人类产生的Elo分数有91%的相关性，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单、低成本的Elo分数代理，无需人类数据或先验知识即可计算LLM性能评估。

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform
significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count.
Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The
current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing
it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since
humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM
is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model
as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own
human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can
be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

Motivation: 研究多轮多智能体编排是否能通过集体智慧超越单个LLM的性能，并探索影响编排效果的因素。

Method: 使用四种LLM在三个基准测试上进行实验：基准测试比较编排与单模型性能；消融实验研究作者身份可见性和实时投票显示对编排的影响。

Result: 编排方法匹配或超越最强单模型，一致优于其他模型。显示作者身份会增加自投票和平局，显示实时投票会放大从众效应，加速收敛但可能导致过早共识。

Conclusion: 多智能体编排是提升LLM性能的有效方法，但需谨慎设计交互机制以避免自投票和从众效应等负面影响。

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language
model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing
answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5
Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we
conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM
baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who
authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration
matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the
others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential
for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases
self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which
speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能力显著，但也带来了新的安全挑战，特别是提示越狱攻击能让模型输出偏离人类价值观。

Method: 使用强化学习将越狱提示形式化为语义和结构描述，构建GraphRAG系统利用相关术语和形式化符号作为上下文输入。

Result: 在常见开源模型上进行了广泛实验，证明了攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: PASS框架能够有效发现LLM对齐方法中的漏洞，实现更有效的越狱攻击。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt
jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to
elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover
vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework
(\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and
\underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement
learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions,
which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses.
The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by
leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input
alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates
more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common
open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

Conclusion: 该模型为现代中医推荐提供了新范式，能够更好地处理个性化信息和草药配伍关系，提高处方推荐的准确性和安全性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending
prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have
made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in
prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i)
Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI,
and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and
reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data
introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The
oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among
herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment
based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we
propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation
model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely
TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using
patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive
learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous
graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally
capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a
heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing
relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation
process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data
distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one
clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we
incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate
the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm
for the recommendation of modern TCM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈在LLM对齐中至关重要，但反馈通常存在噪声或不一致，会降低奖励模型质量并阻碍对齐。目前缺乏对数据清洗方法有效性和泛化性的系统评估。

Method: 引入PrefCleanBench基准，提供标准化协议来评估清洗策略在不同数据集、模型架构和优化算法下的对齐性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该基准为通过改善数据质量来提升LLM对齐的可靠和可复现方法奠定了基础，强调了数据预处理在负责任AI开发中的重要作用。

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

TL;DR: BridgeDrive是一种基于锚点引导的扩散桥策略，用于闭环轨迹规划，在Bench2Drive基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，成功率比现有方法提高了5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散规划器在自动驾驶中表现出色，但如何在反应式闭环环境中有效引导这些模型仍是一个重大挑战。简单的条件化方法在复杂动态驾驶场景中无法提供足够指导，而现有锚点引导方法依赖截断调度，存在理论不一致性和性能问题。

Method: 提出BridgeDrive，一种新颖的锚点引导扩散桥策略，提供原则性的扩散框架，将锚点有效转化为细粒度轨迹规划，并能适当响应变化的交通条件。该方法与高效ODE求解器兼容，适合实时自动驾驶部署。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，成功率比现有方法提高了5%。

Conclusion: BridgeDrive通过锚点引导的扩散桥策略成功解决了闭环轨迹规划中的引导问题，为自动驾驶提供了有效的实时规划解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

TL;DR: PSG-Agent是一个个性化和动态的LLM代理防护系统，通过挖掘用户交互历史创建个性化防护策略，并实现跨轮次的风险累积监控，显著优于现有防护方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理防护存在两个根本问题：对所有用户应用统一防护策略，忽略了同一行为对不同用户的风险差异；孤立检查每个响应，未能捕捉跨多个交互的风险演化和累积。

Method: PSG-Agent首先通过挖掘交互历史中的稳定特征和实时查询状态创建个性化防护策略；其次在整个代理流水线中实施持续监控，包括计划监控器、工具防火墙、响应防护器和内存守护者等专门防护组件。

Result: 在医疗、金融和日常生活自动化等多个场景中验证，PSG-Agent显著优于包括LlamaGuard3和AGrail在内的现有代理防护方法。

Conclusion: PSG-Agent为LLM代理提供了可执行和可审计的个性化安全路径，有效解决了现有防护系统的局限性。

Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in
critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from
two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all
users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being
safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks
evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we
propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.
First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction
history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,
generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,
PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with
specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard,
Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable
verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including
healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user
profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including
LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward
personalized safety for LLM-based agents.

Motivation: 现有基于文本原理的行为克隆方法只能让小型语言模型模仿表面模式而非底层算法结构，导致逻辑鲁棒性不足。

Method: 将推理重构为结构化生成过程，首先将教师思维过程抽象为离散语义信号序列，然后通过多任务目标训练学生模型预测下一个语义信号并生成对应推理步骤。

Result: 在多个挑战性推理基准测试中，该方法在准确性和逻辑一致性方面显著优于最先进的蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为创建真正具备推理能力而非仅能流利模仿的小型模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models
(LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It
teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather
than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical
lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation
should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning
Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation
process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a
sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)
that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task
objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the
reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that
signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the
student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a
suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,
providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,
not just fluent mimics.

Result: 在15亿参数模型上的实验表明，该方法在分布内和分布外基准测试中都优于标准RLVR。

Conclusion: 通过将RLVR从黑盒优化重新定义为结构自组织的可预测过程，为未来AI系统涌现推理能力的工程化提供了新的物理直觉。

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain
poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped
response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena
can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process
maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology
remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This
topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first
drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''
form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp
growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by
phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,
we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an
SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the
competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.
Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms
standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By
recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of
structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for
engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

base. Experiments show GO-AEC reduces character error rate by 6.22% and
sentence error rate by 29.71%, significantly improving ASR accuracy in gaming
scenarios.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

Motivation: 搜索代理连接LLM与互联网，虽然能获取更广泛和更新的信息，但不可靠的搜索结果可能对终端用户构成安全威胁，建立了一个新的威胁面。

Method: 提出了一个系统化、可扩展且成本效益高的自动化红队框架，构建了包含300个测试用例的SafeSearch基准，涵盖五类风险。评估了三种代表性搜索代理架构和15个后端LLM。

Result: 发现LLM搜索代理存在严重漏洞：当暴露于不可靠网站时，GPT-4.1-mini在搜索工作流设置下的最高攻击成功率可达90.5%。常见防御实践如提醒提示的有效性有限。

Conclusion: 强调该框架在促进更安全的代理开发透明度方面的价值，代码库和测试用例已公开。

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases

TL;DR: 提出了一种评估稀疏自编码器特征敏感性的可扩展方法，发现许多可解释特征敏感性较差，且平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAE特征分析主要关注激活示例，但无法揭示特征敏感性——即特征在类似文本上的激活可靠性

Method: 使用语言模型生成与特征激活示例具有相同语义属性的文本，然后测试特征是否在这些生成文本上激活

Result: 敏感性衡量了特征质量的新维度，许多可解释特征敏感性较差；人类评估确认当特征在生成文本上不激活时，这些文本确实与原始激活示例相似

Conclusion: 特征敏感性是评估单个特征和SAE架构的新维度，平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic
interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by
examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align
with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature
sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its
activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate
feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language
descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with
the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test
whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that
sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many
interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that
when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely
resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature
sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity
declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes
feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features
and SAE architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体方法依赖固定角色或浅层交互提示，难以检测和解决细粒度逻辑不一致问题。复杂医疗问题需要领域专业知识、患者特定信息以及结构化、多视角的推理。

Method: 每个智能体基于三段论（大前提、小前提和结论）将其推理过程组织成明确的逻辑树，实现透明推理和前提级对齐。智能体通过多轮图引导讨论来比较和迭代优化逻辑树，通过错误纠正和矛盾解决达成共识。

Result: MedLA在MedDDx和标准医疗QA任务等具有挑战性的基准测试中，持续优于静态角色系统和单智能体基线。该框架在开源和商业LLM骨干网络上都能有效扩展，达到最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: MedLA为可信赖的医疗推理提供了一个可推广的范式，通过逻辑驱动的多智能体协作实现了更可靠的医疗问题解决。

Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and
patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective
reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow
interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained
logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a
logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent
organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on
syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling
transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a
multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their
logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction
resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both
static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks
such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA}
scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm
for trustworthy medical reasoning.

Conclusion: 外部专家协助最终将专家知识内化到策略模型中，放大了模型的固有推理能力，在评估时模型能够独立解决问题，产生改进的推理路径和更准确的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when
optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing
methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM
reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a
novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn
interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where
policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively
determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and
more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately
internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been
well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning
paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO
consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and
RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through
tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and
template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly
build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile
and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure
root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct
a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We
additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure
the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a
taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution
across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a
benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in
which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show
that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its
utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at
most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light
of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such
agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure
root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy
and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of
more reliable agentic systems.

address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model
that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is
trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features
human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve
both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As
far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process
supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon
tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark,
GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO,
significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used
as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits
generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points
as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results
establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more
capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

Motivation: 解决可解释AI中生成基于人类可理解概念的视觉解释的挑战，提供忠实且可解释的决策过程。

Method: 使用对象中心表示和透明多智能体推理过程，通过博弈论驱动智能体就一致且区分性证据达成共识，端到端训练。

Result: 在两个诊断性多对象数据集上，与GradCAM、LIME等后处理解释工具相比，OCEAN在保持与最先进黑盒模型竞争性能的同时，用户研究显示其解释更直观可信。

Conclusion: OCEAN框架通过对象中心表示和多智能体推理，实现了既高性能又忠实可解释的视觉AI决策过程。

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is
producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle
this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a
novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric
representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The
game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and
discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable
decision-making process. We train OCEAN end-to-end and benchmark it against
standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM
and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate
competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with
a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where
participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and
trustworthy.

TL;DR: ChemMAS是一个多智能体系统，将化学反应条件预测重构为基于证据的推理任务，通过分解为机制基础、多通道召回、约束感知的智能体辩论和理由聚合等步骤，提供可解释的推荐理由。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法很少解释推荐反应条件的原理，限制了在高风险科学工作流程中的实用性。需要开发能够提供可解释理由的AI系统来增强人类信任度。

Method: 将条件预测重构为基于证据的推理任务，分解为四个步骤：机制基础、多通道召回、约束感知的智能体辩论和理由聚合。每个决策都有基于化学知识和检索先例的可解释理由支持。

Result: ChemMAS在Top-1准确率上比领域特定基线提高20-35%，比通用大语言模型提高10-15%，同时提供可证伪、人类可信的理由。

Conclusion: ChemMAS为科学发现中的可解释AI建立了新范式，通过多智能体辩论框架提供基于证据的化学反应条件推荐。

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

Conclusion: FalconEye有潜力成为多模态大语言模型的实用安全审计工具，为MLLMs的安全性评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large
language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth.
This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating
content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in
current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale
vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm
categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes
across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a
comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it
includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the
corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator
fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and
safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other
baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two
widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as
a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores adaptive problem solving with a game designed to support
the development of problem-solving skills. Using an adaptive, AI-powered puzzle
game, our adaptive problem-solving system dynamically generates
pathfinding-based puzzles using a genetic algorithm, tailoring the difficulty
of each puzzle to individual players in an online real-time approach. A
player-modeling system records user interactions and informs the generation of
puzzles to approximate a target difficulty level based on various metrics of
the player. By combining procedural content generation with online adaptive
difficulty adjustment, the system aims to maintain engagement, mitigate
frustration, and maintain an optimal level of challenge. A pilot user study
investigates the effectiveness of this approach, comparing different types of
adaptive difficulty systems and interpreting players' responses. This work lays
the foundation for further research into emotionally informed player models,
advanced AI techniques for adaptivity, and broader applications beyond gaming
in educational settings.

Method: 基于真实客服对话构建Mix-ECom语料库，通过后处理去除用户隐私并添加思维链过程，建立基线并提出动态框架改进性能。

Result: 结果显示当前电商代理由于复杂领域规则导致的幻觉问题，处理电商对话能力不足。

Conclusion: Mix-ECom数据集将公开可用，有助于促进电商代理的进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their
e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce
agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the
e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating
agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain
rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed
Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues
with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically,
Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce
dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented
dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics,
after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines
on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance.
Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to
handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain
rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主AI系统的不可预测性和涌现行为带来重大风险，传统验证方法已不适用，需要转向概率保证。

Method: 作为检查层观察代理的原始I/O，抽象为状态模型转换的形式事件，使用在线学习动态构建和更新马尔可夫决策过程来建模代理的涌现行为，并通过概率模型检查实时验证量化属性。

Result: 提出了AgentGuard框架，实现了对自主AI系统的运行时验证。

Conclusion: AgentGuard为自主AI系统提供了有效的运行时验证解决方案，通过动态概率保证应对系统的不确定性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant
risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also
renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift
towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system
will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This
paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI
systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm
called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection
layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events
corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to
dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally
models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the
framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

Motivation: 解决长时程任务中结果奖励导致的奖励校准问题，传统观点认为结果奖励会错误强化有缺陷的中间步骤，但本文要重新审视这一观点并识别真正的训练问题。

Method: 提出训练actor对好坏动作进行分类，以分离好/坏动作的嵌入表示，从而减轻梯度干扰。通过理论分析和实验验证梯度耦合问题及其解决方案。

Result: 理论分析表明结果奖励实际上确保了对错误步骤的负优势，但梯度耦合会导致某些错误动作被增强。提出的分类方法在广泛实验中显示出有效性。

Conclusion: 结果奖励本身不会强化错误动作，真正的挑战在于梯度耦合问题。通过分类好坏动作来分离嵌入可以有效缓解梯度干扰，提高训练效果。

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks
has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause
reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward
to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad
actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based
reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which
means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting
for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should
increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows
that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify
gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the
input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited,
therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can
inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input
observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some
flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the
actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad
actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows
its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 这项工作为使用纤维化作为形式化工具来解释神经网络学习的逻辑理论开辟了道路，将计算逻辑工具应用于神经网络解释。

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining
countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common
semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring
of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining
learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the
(pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing
the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the
original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural
networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this
paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models
\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we
then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.
Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring
as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks
with the tools of computational logic.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法通过奖励或优势塑造引入先验知识，但需要手动调整超参数且方向性假设可能导致失败。

Method: CANON方法将采样响应按目标指标高低分组，通过组间比较确定哪个指标趋势贡献更好性能，并在组内识别更好响应。

Result: 基于熵的CANON在三个LLM上对数学推理和高复杂度逻辑任务均优于先前方法；应用于响应长度时进一步提高了token效率。

Conclusion: CANON提供了一种无需预设方向性的优势估计方法，在提升推理性能和token效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持可解释性的前提下，能够有效自动化文献筛选过程，支持更多类型的信息源。

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming
tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of
artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively
being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection
can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in
scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach,
called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a
literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable
rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a
grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to
easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not
considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is
possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability
and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

Conclusion: TusoAI能够自主开发优化计算方法，加速科学发现并揭示新的生物学见解。

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of
computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such
tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review
literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,
and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,
reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering
new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing
LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing
computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for
general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured
knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an
agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation
function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the
application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree
representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model
diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We
conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI
outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI
agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and
satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in
genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,
including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes
and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their
target genes. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a
LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both
academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model
based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural
language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline
orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals
for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design,
modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows,
and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review
LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering
for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data
(e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling),
(iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding,
programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g.,
data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the
remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for
advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.

Abstract: Learning to learn is becoming a science, driven by the convergence of
knowledge tracing, signal processing, and generative AI to model student
learning states and optimize education. We propose CoTutor, an AI-driven model
that enhances Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with signal processing techniques to
improve student progress modeling and deliver adaptive feedback and strategies.
Deployed as an AI copilot, CoTutor combines generative AI with adaptive
learning technology. In university trials, it has demonstrated measurable
improvements in learning outcomes while outperforming conventional educational
tools. Our results highlight its potential for AI-driven personalization,
scalability, and future opportunities for advancing privacy and ethical
considerations in educational technology. Inspired by Richard Hamming's vision
of computer-aided 'learning to learn,' CoTutor applies convex optimization and
signal processing to automate and scale up learning analytics, while reserving
pedagogical judgment for humans, ensuring AI facilitates the process of
knowledge tracing while enabling learners to uncover new insights.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 单次运行的LLM排行榜不可靠，需要至少2次重复运行来获得稳定的模型排名结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM排行榜通常只使用单次随机运行，但需要多少次重复才能得出可靠结论尚不清楚

Method: 在AI4Math基准上对8个最先进模型进行3次独立运行，使用混合效应逻辑回归、领域级边际均值、排名不稳定性和运行间可靠性分析

Result: 单次运行排行榜很脆弱：83%的切片至少出现一次排名反转；两次运行可消除约83%的单次运行排名反转

Conclusion: 应将评估视为实验，报告不确定性，在随机解码下使用≥2次重复运行，这能提高鲁棒性且对小团队可行

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

TL;DR: Fathom-DeepResearch是一个由两个专门模型组成的智能系统：Fathom-Search-4B用于基于证据的网络搜索调查，Fathom-Synthesizer-4B用于将搜索结果转化为结构化研究报告。该系统在多个基准测试中达到开源权重类别的最先进性能。


<details>

Motivation: 工具集成推理已成为实现智能应用的关键焦点，DeepResearch智能体因其在复杂、开放式信息搜索任务中的强大表现而受到广泛关注。

Method: 系统包含两个专门模型：1) Fathom-Search-4B：基于Qwen3-4B训练，通过DUETQA数据集、RAPO强化学习和可引导的步骤级奖励进行优化；2) Fathom-Synthesizer-4B：将多轮搜索轨迹转化为结构化研究报告。

Result: 在DeepSearch基准测试（SimpleQA、FRAMES、WebWalker等）和DeepResearch-Bench上达到开源权重类别的最先进性能，并在HLE、AIME-25、GPQA-Diamond、MedQA等多样化推理任务中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Fathom-DeepResearch系统通过专门化的搜索和合成模型，在复杂信息搜索任务中实现了卓越性能，证明了工具集成推理在智能应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning has emerged as a key focus for enabling agentic
applications. Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant
attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended
information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system
composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch
model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation
through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines
three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent
self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source
grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes
multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum
pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and
(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive
behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory
breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of
tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is
Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn
DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for
comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,
WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating
strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,
GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.

Motivation: 解决非技术用户与复杂数据仓库交互的挑战，弥合语义鸿沟，确保在数据敏感领域部署可信赖的AI系统。

Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing
and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language
interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly
addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users
to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,
translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to
overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to
transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning
framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full
interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business
rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance
mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:
it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance
against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the
detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical
depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations
from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative
evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation
framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The
agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to
perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and
generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach
creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered
agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RPO是一个鲁棒偏好优化框架，通过EM算法推断标签正确性的后验概率，自适应重加权训练损失来缓解噪声，将现有对齐算法转化为鲁棒版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类偏好的对齐方法（如RLHF）假设人类偏好是同质的且数据无噪声，但现实中人类偏好是多元的且标注者会犯错，导致数据与真实偏好存在差异，误导模型性能。

Method: 使用期望最大化算法推断每个标签正确性的后验概率，自适应重加权训练损失；建立偏好损失与概率模型的理论联系，系统地将现有对齐算法转化为鲁棒版本。

Result: RPO作为元框架持续提升了四种最先进对齐算法（DPO、IPO、SimPO、CPO）的性能；在Mistral和Llama 3模型上，RPO增强方法在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard上分别实现了高达7.0%和5.4%的胜率提升。

Conclusion: RPO是一个有效的鲁棒偏好对齐元框架，在完美校准模型条件下能收敛到数据集的真实噪声水平，显著提升现有对齐算法的性能。

Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all
underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are
homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data
is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human
preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a
discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which
can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,
we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of
each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point
in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by
establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their
corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic
transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,
elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust
preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a
perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise
level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a
meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment
algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3
models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%,
respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出基于行为经济学前景理论的人类感知解释，证明在线对齐方法（如GRPO）优于离线方法（如DPO）的原因在于其更好地模拟了人类对概率的感知偏差，并提出了一种新的训练范式——humanline变体，能在离线训练中达到在线方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么在线对齐方法通常比离线方法表现更好，从人类感知角度提供理论解释，并寻求在不牺牲性能的前提下实现更快速、廉价、灵活的后训练方法。

Method: 基于前景理论分析人类对概率的感知偏差，提出将感知失真显式融入DPO/KTO/GRPO等目标函数的humanline变体，即使使用离线非策略数据训练也能达到在线方法的性能。

Result: humanline变体在可验证和不可验证任务上都能匹配其在线对应方法的性能，证明了通过模拟人类感知进行选择性训练可以达到与在线训练相同的效果。

Conclusion: 在线/离线二分法本身与最大化人类效用无关，关键在于训练方式是否模拟了人类感知，这为更高效灵活的对齐方法提供了理论基础和实现路径。

Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline
alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral
economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online
on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what
the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to
just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive
probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our
theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental
to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by
selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,
rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would
allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing
performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly
incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like
DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that
these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can
match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and
unverifiable tasks.

TL;DR: ELHPlan是一个基于动作链的多机器人协作规划框架，通过意图绑定的动作序列作为规划原语，在保持适应性的同时显著降低计算成本，仅需最先进方法24%的token消耗即可达到相似任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在多机器人协作中的基本权衡：声明式方法在动态环境中缺乏适应性，而迭代方法计算成本过高且随团队规模和任务复杂性扩展性差。

Method: 提出动作链作为规划原语，采用循环过程：构建意图绑定的动作序列、主动验证冲突和可行性、通过针对性机制精炼问题、执行验证后的动作。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，ELHPlan达到可比的任务成功率，同时仅消耗最先进方法24%的token，建立了LLM多智能体规划系统的效率-效果新前沿。

Conclusion: ELHPlan通过动作链设计在适应性和效率之间取得平衡，提供了足够的规划视野同时避免昂贵的完全重新规划，为LLM多智能体协作规划建立了新的效率-效果边界。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but
face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic
environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs
that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose
ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions
explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive.
ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action
sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining
issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This
design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning
horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose
comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning
time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments
on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable
task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by
state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new
efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

TL;DR: FR-Ponder是一个无需修改主干模型权重的推理计算分配框架，通过潜在向量引导实现实例自适应推理深度，在保持准确性的同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Best-of-N和多数投票对所有输入使用统一的推理深度，导致简单问题浪费计算资源，复杂问题推理不足。需要一种能够根据问题复杂度自适应分配计算的方法。

Method: 使用小于1M参数的控制器观察隐藏状态，决定停止推理或应用小步推理。通过提取与深度推理输出相关的潜在引导向量，以可调缩放因子重新应用，实现推理深度自适应。采用GRPO作为奖励信号来平衡性能和计算成本。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，FR-Ponder改善了计算-准确性边界，以更低的FLOPs实现更好的匹配准确性，优于早期退出基线方法。

Conclusion: FR-Ponder通过潜在向量引导实现了有效的推理计算分配，学习到的计算分配与问题难度相关，无需修改主干模型权重即可提升推理效率。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管模型融合在实践中广泛应用，但缺乏定量规则来预测随着专家数量增加或模型规模扩展时的收益回报。

Method: 通过经验性研究语言模型融合的缩放规律，测量交叉熵，分析不同架构和方法（Average、TA、TIES、DARE）下的融合效果。

Result: 发现了一个紧凑的幂律关系：模型大小相关的下限随模型容量减少，而融合尾部显示专家数量的收益递减。该规律在不同领域和架构中都成立。

Conclusion: 该缩放定律使融合从启发式实践转变为可计算、可规划的替代多任务训练的方法，为分布式生成AI提供了可预测的增益路径。

Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by
cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative
rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We
identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the
size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail
exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds
in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse
architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust
regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts
are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why
gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the
base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive
planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide
when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding
experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a
computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This
suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains
can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward
AGI-level systems.

Motivation: 大型推理模型存在过度思考问题，产生过长输出和延迟，影响实际部署。现有提前退出机制依赖探测机制，引入检测开销并限制延迟收益和泛化能力。

Method: 受推测解码中隐藏状态启发，提出SpecExit框架，直接从轻量级草稿模型预测未来token和提前退出信号，无需探测开销。

Result: 相比推测解码基线，平均生成长度减少66%，端到端延迟加速2.5倍，且不损害准确性。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态可提供有效的提前退出信号，表明隐藏状态在高效推理中具有更广泛的应用价值。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most
prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative
tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions
about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic
process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and
correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address
this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis
problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated
demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified
modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without
requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system
to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users
taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of
participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90
percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced
unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to
teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline
mitigation strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在图推理任务中表现不佳，主要原因是方法不当和基准测试不够挑战性。作者发现基础模型的能力被低估，需要重新思考图推理的发展方向。

Method: 提出Simple-RTC方法，引导LLM先设计图算法，然后编写代码来解决图推理任务。同时构建了包含239个不同图问题和3,041个测试实例的GraphAlgorithm基准。

Result: Simple-RTC在现有基准测试上达到近乎完美的准确率，在GraphAlgorithm基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini和所有先前方法。

Conclusion: 通过重新定向推理重点，基础模型能够解决大多数图推理任务。Simple-RTC为LLM图推理研究提供了强大的基线，鼓励未来进一步发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively
studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph
structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph
algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the
potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is
underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and
benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should
strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely
underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning
focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily
solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the
graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging
GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041
test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a
simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which
guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph
reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing
benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on
the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further
advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial
policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of
solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution
diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often
distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning
strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that
interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm,
Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying
learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement,
requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k
performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

TL;DR: PAME-AI是一个基于智能代理AI的患者消息创建和优化系统，通过DIKW层次结构从原始数据中生成可操作的消息设计策略，在医疗通信中显著提高了患者参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统移动消息设计由于无法探索高维设计空间而存在显著局限性，需要一种能够从大量实验数据中自动优化医疗通信的方法。

Method: 基于DIKW层次结构，构建了一个由专门计算代理组成的系统，逐步将原始实验数据转化为可操作的消息设计策略，支持并行处理、假设验证和持续学习。

Result: 在两阶段实验中（第一阶段444,691次患者接触，第二阶段74,908次），最佳生成消息的参与度达到68.76%，相比61.27%的基线提升了12.2%的相对点击率。

Conclusion: PAME-AI的代理架构特别适合大规模医疗通信优化，能够显著提高患者消息的参与度和有效性。

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,
representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic
architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous
learning, making it particularly suitable for large-scale healthcare
communication optimization.

TL;DR: AdvChain：一种通过对抗性思维链调优来增强大型推理模型安全性的对齐范式，解决了思维链推理中的雪球效应问题，使模型能够动态自我修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维链安全调优方法存在雪球效应问题，即微小的推理偏差会在思维过程中逐渐放大，导致有害合规或过度拒绝。模型仅模仿完美推理脚本而缺乏自我修正能力。

Method: 构建包含诱惑-修正和犹豫-修正样本的数据集，通过对抗性思维链调优训练模型从有害推理漂移和不必要谨慎中恢复，实现动态自我修正。

Result: AdvChain显著增强了对抗越狱攻击和思维链劫持的鲁棒性，同时大幅减少对良性提示的过度拒绝，在不损害推理能力的情况下实现了更好的安全-效用平衡。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更鲁棒可靠的推理模型确立了新方向，证明了通过对抗性调优实现动态自我修正的有效性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

TL;DR: G-reasoner是一个统一框架，通过整合图与语言基础模型，使用标准化的QuadGraph抽象层和34M参数的图基础模型(GFM)，在六个基准测试中显著提升了LLM在图结构知识上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成(RAG)方法在知识密集型任务中存在信息碎片化和知识结构建模弱的问题，而图增强RAG方法又受限于特定的图设计、启发式搜索或昂贵的代理管道，影响了可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出QuadGraph四层抽象统一异构知识源，构建34M参数的图基础模型(GFM)联合捕获图拓扑和文本语义，并与LLM集成增强推理，采用混合精度训练和分布式消息传递实现可扩展性。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，G-reasoner持续优于最先进的基线方法，显著增强了LLM推理能力，并实现了强大的效率和跨图泛化性能。

Conclusion: G-reasoner通过统一的图-语言框架有效解决了现有RAG方法的局限性，为知识密集型推理任务提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by
static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs
struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak
modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model
relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot
effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG
(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and
enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc
graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder
scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present
G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation
models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our
approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies
heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on
this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly
captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to
enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and
efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are
implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency
and cross-graph generalization.

Conclusion: SCI-VerifyBench和SCI-Verifier为科学验证提供了原则性框架，既提供系统性评估，又为增强LLM在科学领域的可靠性和适用性提供了实用途径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在医疗基准测试中表现良好，但在早期证据解释中存在不稳定性，导致幻觉和推理轨迹分支，最终产生全局不一致的结论，需要构建可靠且可审计的临床推理系统。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，通过多样化短期推理稳定推理过程，在幻觉检测器监督下将中间步骤基于结构化证据图，并使用组合不确定性评分器聚合候选路径。

Result: 在六个医疗基准测试中，准确率提升高达12.7%，更重要的是展示了更优越的可靠性。盲法医师评估证实MedMMV显著提高了推理真实性而不牺牲信息内容。

Conclusion: 通过可验证的多智能体过程控制不稳定性，该框架为在高风险领域（如临床决策支持）部署可信AI系统提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as
clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a
critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes
hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into
globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical
reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing
auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal
multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV
stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate
steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination
Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On
six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more
critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations
confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without
sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a
verifiable, multi-agent process, our framework provides a robust path toward
deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes domains like clinical decision
support.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融科技行业快速发展，但LLMs的大规模微调有时会产生不专业或轻率的回复，这会损害用户信任。现有研究因领域特定数据稀缺而只关注孤立组件，需要综合解决方案。

Method: 1) 引入多轮金融对话数据集Fin-Vault（1,417个标注对话）；2) 开发统一模型Fin-Ally，集成COMET-BART嵌入的常识上下文，并通过直接偏好优化(DPO)机制优化，生成人类对齐的响应。

Conclusion: 该方法代表了金融科技领域的下一代AI解决方案，通过综合的常识推理和人类偏好优化，显著提升了金融咨询的专业性和可靠性。

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has
significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots.
However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional
or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the
world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and
erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous
studies to focus on isolated components, such as reasoning-aware frameworks or
the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research
gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the
multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a
unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness,
and human-like conversational dynamics. Fin-Ally is powered by
COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel
Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables
Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized
budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our
comprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context
enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and
professionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a
next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector. Dataset and codes are

TL;DR: 提出自适应蒙特卡洛搜索（AMCS）框架，通过动态节点值估计和路径扩展改进过程奖励模型（PRM）的数据生成效率，构建了20万规模的数据集MathSearch-200K，在数学推理基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于固定预算采样策略估计推理步骤质量，在自动数据生成过程中需要遍历巨大搜索空间进行路径扩展，导致效率低下且缺乏灵活性。

Method: AMCS框架将数据生成从固定静态搜索转变为自适应动态搜索：1）自适应细化估计，为不确定推理步骤分配更多样本；2）通过具有时间自适应策略的蒙特卡洛算法增强路径扩展，从广泛探索逐步转向最有希望的方向。

Result: Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS在MATH500上达到76.2%准确率，优于所有基线PRM。7B模型在AMCS监督下超越72B弱监督模型，并在分布外问题上保持优势，展示强泛化能力。

Conclusion: AMCS通过自适应搜索策略显著提高了过程奖励模型的数据生成效率和效果，为提升大型语言模型的复杂数学推理能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward
Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of
large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps
based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to
perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting
in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose
Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation
from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value
estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation
by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer
samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances
the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive
policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward
exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale
dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training
PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results
show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500
with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised
by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.
Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on
out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

TL;DR: PRISM是一个新颖的数学推理框架，通过策略规划和目标执行两阶段方法，自适应地选择最佳推理策略，在多个数学推理基准测试中显著优于单一策略和集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用固定策略进行数学推理，无法适应问题特定需求，忽视了效果和效率之间的权衡。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，包含策略规划和目标执行两个阶段。首先创建多策略偏好数据集MathStrat，然后训练轻量级策略适配器获得四种推理策略的置信度分布。推理时使用自适应路由策略动态选择推理方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，PRISM始终优于单一策略和集成基线，在不同基础模型上实现了0.9%到7.6%的改进。自适应路由方法在各种模型架构的数学推理任务中表现出特别强的优势。

Conclusion: PRISM通过自适应策略选择有效解决了数学推理中效果与效率的权衡问题，为LLM的数学推理提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language
reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or
ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot
adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and
Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that
decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and
targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference
dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and
computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a
lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence
distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time,
an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on
predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for
high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive
scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.
Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble
baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different
base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits
for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code
is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的链式推理中常包含有害内容，即使最终回答看似安全，这些不安全推理仍可能被恶意用户利用，因此需要专门对齐推理过程的安全性。

Method: 提出IPO方法：分析安全推理特征，发现安全触发器、合规线索与不安全延续的关联、纠正干预的有效性；通过替换合规步骤为安全触发器，构建强信号偏好学习对进行对齐。

Result: 在越狱和对抗安全基准测试中，IPO显著提升推理和回答的整体安全性，相比SFT和RL基线将有害性相对降低超过30%，同时在多样化推理任务中保持优异性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了推理过程显式对齐的重要性，为构建更安全的大型推理模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of industrial systems, there is a pressing
need for predictive maintenance to avoid costly downtime and disastrous
outcomes that could be life-threatening in certain domains. With the growing
popularity of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, machine
learning, and real-time big data analytics, there is a unique opportunity for
efficient predictive maintenance to forecast equipment failures for real-time
intervention and optimize maintenance actions, as traditional reactive and
preventive maintenance practices are often inadequate to meet the requirements
for the industry to provide quality-of-services of operations. Central to this
evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that
continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset
performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such
as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This
paper aims to address this void. We perform a retrospective analysis of the
temporal evolution of the digital twin in predictive maintenance for industrial
engineering to capture the applications, middleware, and technological
requirements that led to the development of the digital twin from its inception
to the AI-enabled digital twin and its self-learning models. We provide a

Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型在数学领域表现良好，但由于领域特定训练数据稀缺和基于知识的学习模式，在其他领域的泛化能力有限。

Method: 将学习目标从验证领域特定知识转向建模领域无关的逻辑流，关注思维链步骤间的上下文连贯性，采用新的数据标注和训练框架。

Result: ContextPRM在MMLU-Pro的9个非数学领域（法律、历史、哲学等）通过加权多数投票实现6.5%平均准确率提升，显著优于VersaPRM的2.2%和其他数学导向PRM的0.5%提升。

Conclusion: 通过关注逻辑流而非领域知识，ContextPRM在数学和非数学领域都表现出色，显著提升了过程奖励模型的跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit
substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific
training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization
ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the
learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling
domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between
chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data
annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization
capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,
ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the
majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine
non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy,
significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from
other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across
both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

### [294] [Overcoming Over-Fitting in Constraint Acquisition via Query-Driven Interactive Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24489)
*Vasileios Balafas,Dimos Tsouros,Nikolaos Ploskas,Kostas Stergiou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合约束获取框架，结合被动学习和主动查询，通过概率置信度识别过拟合约束，有效解决数据有限场景下的约束获取问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统被动约束获取方法在有限数据下容易过拟合，学习到虚假的全局约束，而纯主动方法查询成本高。需要一种平衡的方法来在数据有限情况下实现稳健的约束获取。

Method: 混合框架：1) 被动学习生成候选约束；2) 基于概率置信度的交互式精炼阶段识别过拟合约束；3) 专门子集探索机制从被拒候选约束中恢复有效子结构；4) 最终主动学习确保模型完整性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，交互式精炼阶段对实现高目标模型覆盖率和整体模型准确性至关重要，且查询复杂度可控。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据有限场景下实现了稳健实用的约束获取，是约束获取领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which
Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are
prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global
constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be
query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to
address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive
learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive
refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by
machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints,
and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures
from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model
completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model
coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with
manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial
advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited
scenarios.

Method: 提出Neuroplastic Multi-Task Network (NMT-Net)，每个新任务触发动态网络适应，包括相似性任务识别、选择性训练候选ANN头，然后基于性能评估和集成到模型中。

Result: 在三个真实世界多任务需求预测数据集上评估，相比传统基线和最先进的多任务学习方法，实现了更低的RMSE和标准差，表现出优越的性能和一致性。

Conclusion: NMT-Net为时间序列预测中的多任务和持续学习提供了可扩展、适应性强的解决方案，完整代码已在GitHub仓库中提供。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks
(D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task
Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time
dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural
adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by
neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic
network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and
selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and
integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our
framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from
Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving
lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and
state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable,
adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series
prediction. The complete code for NMT-Net is available from our GitHub

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统组合优化问题需要大量领域知识和手工设计的启发式算法，现有基于LLM的自动启发式设计方法容易陷入局部最优。

Method: EvoPH框架整合岛屿迁移模型和精英选择算法，共同进化提示和启发式算法，通过性能反馈进行指导。

Result: 在旅行商问题和装箱问题上，EvoPH相比最优解获得了最低的相对误差。

Conclusion: EvoPH推动了基于LLM的自动算法设计领域的发展。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

TL;DR: Dreamer 4是一个可扩展的智能体，通过在世界模型中进行强化学习来解决控制任务。在复杂的Minecraft游戏中，该世界模型能准确预测物体交互和游戏机制，性能远超之前的世界模型，并且是第一个仅从离线数据中在Minecraft获得钻石的智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的世界模型无法准确预测复杂环境中的物体交互，而环境交互在机器人等实际应用中可能不安全且缓慢。因此需要开发能够从离线数据中学习的智能体。

Method: 使用快捷强制目标和高效的transformer架构构建快速准确的世界模型，从少量数据中学习通用动作条件，主要从多样化的无标签视频中提取知识，通过想象训练学习行为。

Result: 在Minecraft游戏中，世界模型准确预测物体交互和游戏机制，性能大幅超越之前的世界模型。Dreamer 4是第一个仅从离线数据中在Minecraft获得钻石的智能体，需要从原始像素中选择超过20,000个鼠标和键盘动作序列。

Conclusion: 这项工作为想象训练提供了可扩展的解决方案，标志着向智能代理迈出了一步。

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for
training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents.
However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object
interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent
that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast
and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model
accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming
previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time
interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and
an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent
agents.

<details>

Motivation: 解决AI系统在数据稀缺的主观任务中难以快速学习的问题，需要重现人类从少量示例学习新概念的能力。

Result: 在食材替换任务中，代理仅用100个示例就达到了完整训练集50k示例一半的任务性能。

Conclusion: 通过战略性地提供示例并结合利用外部符号知识的学习方法，代理能够更有效地进行泛化。

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples.
Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven
to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an
evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we
propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can
teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,
examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be
able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our
objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.
Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a
limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most
representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply
our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where
the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on
human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our
experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100
examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.
We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning
method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize
more efficiently.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了在通信游戏中，即使个体使用不同的信号解释也能成功协调的现象，称为"成功的误解"。虽然这种误解不会立即导致协调失败，但会阻碍与新伙伴建立有效协调。研究发现至少需要三个相互交互的个体才能确保共享解释的出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通信评估的基本假设——成功协调意味着相互理解。在个体感知环境差异很大的情况下（如人类与AI混合群体），探讨通信信号如何在没有共同观察的情况下发展。

Method: 使用信号游戏作为代理模型，个体在没有共同观察的情况下发展新的信号词汇，仅通过通信信号和交互结果（奖励）来协调。

Result: 群体总能达到最优协调水平，但有时会形成"成功的误解"——使用不同信号解释仍能协调。这种误解难以发现和修复，且阻碍与新伙伴的协调。至少需要三个相互交互的个体才能确保共享解释的出现。

Conclusion: 仅凭协调成功不能保证相互理解。在缺乏共享观察的情况下，群体可能发展出不同的信号解释。为确保共享解释的出现，需要至少三个相互交互的个体，这是补偿缺乏信号使用共享观察的最小条件。

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it
facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through
communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We
investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new
vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals
do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of
the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study
communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their
environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and
artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations
while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always
converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents
interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful
misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using
misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination
with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,
successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least
three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions
to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the
agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack
of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared
interpretations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LRMs在处理困难问题时经常进行无效推理，浪费计算资源并产生错误答案，这反映了现有回答范式忽视了问题与模型能力边界的关系。

Method: 通过分析推理表达中的置信度轨迹和隐藏状态，发现模型能识别自身能力边界。提出推理表达监控和隐藏状态监控两种优化策略。

Result: 实验表明边界感知策略使LRMs避免无效推理而不牺牲准确性，显著提升可靠性和效率，token使用量减少62.7-93.6%。

Conclusion: LRMs确实具有能力边界自我意识，通过简单监控策略可有效识别和避免无效推理，大幅提升模型效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Abstract: Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy,
and non-Euclidean nature. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional

framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the
EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that
simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics.
To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype
Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes
to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the
Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms
prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the
transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive
objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more
generalizable and robust neural representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了逻辑复杂性和语义复杂性的相互作用，难以处理涉及抽象命题、模糊语境和矛盾立场的人类推理场景。

Method: 提出LogicAgent框架，基于符号学方阵进行多视角一阶逻辑演绎，通过三值决策方案（真、假、不确定）进行存在性导入检查以处理边界情况。

Result: 在RepublicQA上平均提升6.25%，在主流逻辑推理基准上平均提升7.05%，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 符号学基础的多视角推理能够显著提升大语言模型的逻辑推理性能。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between
logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle
to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous
contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For
this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to
jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent
explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),
while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that
incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle
boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic
simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce
RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)
and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior
benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring
abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory
relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical
reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art
performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and
generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including
ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%
average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our
semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical
performance.

Conclusion: TSR-Suite是首个全面的时间序列推理套件，TimeOmni-1作为首个统一推理模型，在时间序列推理任务上取得了显著突破，为实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能发现全局能力电路，无法解释模型对特定输入查询为何产生特定输出，需要更本地化的输入级解释。

Method: 引入查询电路概念，开发归一化偏差忠实度(NDF)评估指标，并采用基于采样的方法来高效识别稀疏但忠实的电路。

Result: 在多个基准测试(IOI、算术、MMLU、ARC)中发现存在极稀疏的查询电路，仅覆盖1.3%模型连接即可恢复约60%的MMLU问题性能。

Conclusion: 查询电路为语言模型如何处理单个输入提供了忠实、可扩展的解释方法。

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local,
input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits
(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a
specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which
directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input
to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),
query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more
faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits
practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation
Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit
recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable
to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based
methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully
describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and
ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model
that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a
circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of
performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step
towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process
individual inputs.

TL;DR: 提出了数据推理强度(DRI)指标来量化训练样本的逻辑推理复杂度，并开发了重新认知优化策略，通过增强训练数据的逻辑推理强度而非增加数据量来提升LLM的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注数据格式转换而忽视训练样本内部推理复杂度，导致数据的推理潜力未被充分挖掘和利用。作者认为LLM的逻辑推理性能同时受训练数据潜力和模型认知能力的约束。

Method: 引入数据推理强度(DRI)指标量化样本的潜在逻辑推理复杂度，通过分解和聚合逻辑结构来分析LLM对逻辑推理信号的利用情况。提出重新认知优化策略，系统性地增强训练数据的逻辑推理强度，使其与LLM的逻辑推理边界更好对齐。

Result: 实验表明该方法在性能和泛化能力上显著优于以数据为中心的策略。在强化学习框架下进一步验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 优先考虑数据中的推理复杂度而非单纯的数据规模或表面形式，对于实现LLM的完整认知潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

TL;DR: PhysicsMinions是一个用于物理奥林匹克竞赛的协同进化多智能体系统，通过视觉、逻辑和评审三个工作室的协同工作，在HiPhO基准测试中实现了开源模型的突破性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理奥林匹克竞赛作为物理智能的严格测试平台，需要复杂的推理和多模态理解，但现有AI方法多为单模型且开源模型难以达到金牌水平，因此需要开发更先进的系统。

Method: 提出协同进化多智能体系统，包含三个工作室：视觉工作室解析图表、逻辑工作室制定解决方案、评审工作室进行双阶段验证，通过迭代精炼循环实现自我纠正和收敛。

Result: 在7个最新物理奥林匹克竞赛的HiPhO基准测试中，系统实现了三大突破：强泛化能力、历史性突破（开源模型金牌数从1-2枚增至6枚）、以及达到人类专家水平（在最新IPhO中排名第4）。

Conclusion: PhysicsMinions为奥林匹克级别的问题解决提供了一个可推广的框架，具有跨学科扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the
ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical
intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,
provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal
understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing
approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely
reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose
PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its
architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret
diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform
dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement
loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic
Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground
truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,
PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:
it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different
sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)
Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold
medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in
the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score
metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source
Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406
contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked
22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for
Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across
disciplines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的社会科学研究领域分散，需要系统性的分类框架来整合现有研究，明确证据标准，促进该领域的累积性进展。

Method: 采用文本嵌入、无监督聚类和主题建模的计算方法，对270项研究进行系统综述，构建计算分类法。

Result: 识别出三个有机形成的核心领域：LLM作为社会心智（认知、道德和偏见归因）、LLM社会（多智能体交互与制度）、LLM-人类互动（任务重塑与风险）。

Conclusion: 该分类法为碎片化领域提供了可复现的地图，明确了不同分析层次的证据标准，突出了人工智能社会科学中累积性进展的机会。

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems
evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human
activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies,
combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build
a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed
literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display
behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while
addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies
examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and
mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective
epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks,
learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI
interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field,
clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights
opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial
intelligence.

TL;DR: RealUnify是一个专门评估多模态模型中理解与生成能力双向协同作用的基准，包含1000个标注实例，通过双评估协议揭示当前统一模型在能力协同方面仍存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要孤立评估理解和生成能力，无法确定统一模型是否能利用理解增强生成，或通过生成模拟促进更深理解，因此需要专门评估能力协同的基准。

Method: 构建包含10个类别32个子任务的RealUnify基准，围绕"理解增强生成"和"生成增强理解"两个核心轴，采用结合端到端评估和诊断性分步评估的双评估协议。

Result: 对12个领先统一模型和6个专业基线的评估表明，当前统一模型仍难以实现有效协同，表明仅靠架构统一是不够的。

Conclusion: 需要新的训练策略和归纳偏置来充分释放统一建模的潜力，架构统一本身不足以实现理解与生成能力的有效协同。

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理测量方法成本高、扩展性差，需要探索基于语义嵌入的替代方法，以更高效、灵活地复制心理测量结构。

Method: 提出SQuID方法，使用大语言模型嵌入处理心理测量问卷项目，通过比较多种嵌入模型和评估指标，验证其恢复人类价值观结构的能力。

Result: SQuID成功恢复了修订版肖像价值问卷(PVQ-RR)的结构，解释55%的维度相似性方差，多维标度配置显示良好的因子一致性，与理论基础相符。

Conclusion: 语义嵌入能有效复制传统心理测量结构，在成本、扩展性和灵活性方面具有显著优势，为心理测量和社会科学研究提供了补充方法。

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

Motivation: 现有规范性理论和任务驱动理论在定量仲裁竞争理论和作为归纳偏置改进数据驱动拟合方面存在困难，需要更自动化和可扩展的方法来整合理论知识。

Method: 使用自适应深度核高斯过程，在规范性理论生成的合成数据上元学习核函数，创建理论知情核，该核指定了代表理论预测的概率模型。

Result: 在早期视觉系统应用中，相比传统数据驱动基线，提高了小鼠视网膜神经节细胞对自然场景刺激的响应预测准确性，同时提供良好校准的不确定性估计和可解释表示。

Conclusion: 该工作为神经科学及其他领域提供了一个更通用、可扩展和自动化的方法，将理论知识整合到数据驱动的科学探究中。

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for
biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between
competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve
data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and
often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework
designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative
theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel
Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a
normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model
representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and
rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to
the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We
show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse
retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional
data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we
also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of
theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.
This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for
integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in
neuroscience and beyond.

Conclusion: MASLegalBench为评估法律领域多智能体系统提供了专门工具，有助于推动MAS在法律任务中的应用和发展。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

Motivation: V2X协同感知系统虽然能解决单智能体感知的局限，但由于其复杂的组成（多样传感器类型、协同智能体、不同融合方案和通信条件），带来了许多操作挑战，且当系统产生错误预测时，错误类型和根本原因尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过大规模系统研究，识别和分析协同感知系统中的6种常见错误模式，并系统评估关键组件的影响。

Result: 发现：(1) LiDAR协同配置感知性能最高；(2) V2I和V2V通信在不同融合方案下表现不同；(3) 协同感知错误增加可能导致更多驾驶违规；(4) 协同感知系统对在线运行的通信干扰不鲁棒。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协同感知系统关键组件中存在的潜在风险和漏洞，希望这些发现能促进协同感知系统的设计和修复。

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication
technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the
potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a
single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software
systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying
fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.
Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational
challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous
predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain
insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by
conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically
evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception
performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in
cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of
the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and
identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation
configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion
schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher
frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not
robust against communication interference when running online. Our results
reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of
cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote
the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations,
analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being
adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an
open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop
required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through
experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a
given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large
language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems
without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of
physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer
on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,
and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily
based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as
recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring
Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this
setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains,
without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

Motivation: 现有在线强化学习方法对所有训练样本采用统一处理，忽视了问题难度与模型当前能力之间的差异，导致对已掌握问题的低效探索和对挑战性问题缺乏有效指导。

Method: CLPO利用模型自身表现进行实时难度评估，构建在线课程，通过自适应问题重构机制让模型充当自己的老师：多样化中等难度问题以促进泛化，简化挑战性问题使其更易掌握。

Result: 在8个具有挑战性的数学和通用推理基准测试中，CLPO实现了最先进的性能，平均pass@1相比其他方法提升了6.96%。

Conclusion: CLPO将静态训练过程转变为与模型能力共同进化的动态过程，展示了更高效训练更强推理模型的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training
samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty
relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy
leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,
while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging
its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound
performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for
Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical
feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO
leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty
assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then
guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its
own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote
generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more
attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a
dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show
that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging
mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1
improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more
efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注或有限环境信息提示，成本高且覆盖范围有限，需要高质量、多样化、可执行且可验证的下游代理任务数据集来扩展多模态大语言模型的后期训练。

Method: AutoPlay采用两阶段方法：探索阶段使用MLLM探索代理系统发现新环境状态和功能；任务生成阶段利用探索轨迹和任务指导提示作为上下文，合成多样化、可执行且可验证的任务。

Result: 在20个Android应用中生成20k任务，在13个Ubuntu应用中生成10k任务，训练移动使用和计算机使用代理，成功率分别提高20.0%和10.9%，结合强化学习训练可额外提升5.7%。

Conclusion: AutoPlay为后期训练多模态大语言模型代理提供了一种可扩展的方法，减少了对人工标注的依赖，能够生成高质量的任务数据集。

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive
agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and
robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality
downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and
verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human
annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,
which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited
coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task
generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover
possible interactions and current state information to synthesize
environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration
phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment
states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task
generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline
prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We
show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks
across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use
agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration
synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and
verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success
rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In
addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards
enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an
additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a
scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on
human annotation.

Motivation: 当前深度强化学习方法依赖大量经验且知识编码不透明，需要更通用、可解释的智能体，通过显式推理构建对世界的透明理解。

Method: CEL采用交互-反思循环：每次游戏后分析完整轨迹，进行规则归纳（精炼环境动态模型）和策略总结（将经验提炼为可操作的策略手册）。

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex
environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement
learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge
opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in
which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,
ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language
Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its
environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state
with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of
interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete
trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where
it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and
Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable
strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,
Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent
successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their
rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies
confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work
demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only

Abstract: Heatwaves pose complex cascading risks across interconnected climate, social,
and economic systems, but knowledge fragmentation in scientific literature
hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways. We introduce HeDA
(Heatwave Discovery Agent), an intelligent multi-agent system designed for
automated scientific discovery through knowledge graph construction and
multi-layer risk propagation analysis. HeDA processes over 10,247 academic
papers to construct a comprehensive knowledge graph with 23,156 nodes and
89,472 relationships, employing novel multi-layer risk propagation analysis to
systematically identify overlooked risk transmission pathways. Our system
achieves 78.9% accuracy on complex question-answering tasks, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines including GPT-4 by 13.7%. Critically, HeDA
successfully discovered five previously unidentified high-impact risk chains,
such as the pathway where a heatwave leads to a water demand surge, resulting
in industrial water restrictions and ultimately causing small business
disruption, which were validated through historical case studies and domain
expert review. This work presents a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific
discovery, providing actionable insights for developing more resilient climate
adaptation strategies.

TL;DR: RL确实能让LLMs学习真正的新技能，通过组合现有技能来获得复合能力，这种能力还能迁移到不同任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RL在LLM后训练中究竟是教授新技能还是仅激活现有技能，解决关于RL作用的争议。

Method: 开发合成框架，将技能定义为推断字符串转换函数的能力，研究LLM在RL训练后能否学习未见过的函数组合。

Result: RL使LLM能够学习未见过的函数组合，这种组合能力能泛化到更复杂问题，并能迁移到不同任务中。

Conclusion: RL能从根本上改变模型的推理行为，建议先构建具有基础技能的基模型，再用RL激励高级、可泛化的复杂问题解决技能。

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RLHI（基于人类交互的强化学习）范式，通过从真实用户对话中学习来实现持续模型改进和多方面对齐，包含用户引导重写和基于用户奖励两种方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话模型使用预标注的专家生成反馈进行对齐，但为了实现持续改进和多方面对齐，模型需要从自然的人类交互中学习。

Method: 开发了两种互补方法：(1) RLHI with User-Guided Rewrites：基于用户的自然语言后续响应修订不令人满意的模型输出；(2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards：通过基于用户长期交互历史（称为persona）的奖励模型进行学习。

Result: 在WildChat对话数据上训练，两种RLHI变体在个性化和指令遵循方面都优于强基线，类似反馈还能提升推理基准测试性能。

Conclusion: 自然的人类交互为个性化对齐提供了可扩展且有效的监督方式。

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种通过多视角文本描述增强视觉语言导航中类比推理的方法，在R2R数据集上显著提升了导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本LLM导航代理要么将图像编码为文本场景描述（可能过度简化视觉细节），要么处理原始图像输入（可能无法捕获高级推理所需的抽象语义）。

Method: 通过整合多视角的文本描述来促进图像间的类比推理，利用基于文本的类比推理增强全局场景理解和空间推理。

Result: 在R2R数据集上的实验表明导航性能有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过多视角文本描述和类比推理可以有效增强导航代理的上下文理解能力。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

TL;DR: 提出ReasoningBank记忆框架，从智能体成功和失败经验中提炼可泛化的推理策略，并结合内存感知测试时扩展(MaTTS)来加速学习过程，使智能体能够随时间自我进化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型智能体在持续现实角色中遇到连续任务流时，无法从积累的交互历史中学习，导致丢弃宝贵见解并重复过去错误。

Method: ReasoningBank框架从智能体自我判断的成功和失败经验中提炼推理策略，测试时检索相关记忆指导交互并整合新学习；MaTTS通过扩展智能体交互经验来加速和多样化学习过程。

Result: 在网络浏览和软件工程基准测试中，ReasoningBank持续优于存储原始轨迹或仅成功任务例程的现有记忆机制，提高了有效性和效率；MaTTS进一步放大了这些收益。

Conclusion: 这些发现确立了记忆驱动经验扩展作为一种新的扩展维度，使智能体能够自我进化并自然产生涌现行为。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

TL;DR: VLMs在简单视觉推理任务中表现不如人类，主要原因是缺乏视觉基础的串行处理能力。通过几何推理、感知枚举和心理旋转三个领域的实验，发现VLM准确率下降与人类反应时间增加高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么VLMs在标准基准测试中表现良好，但在简单视觉推理任务中却不如人类，假设是VLMs缺乏视觉基础的串行处理能力。

Method: 在三个领域设计任务：几何推理、感知枚举和心理旋转，通过操纵几何概念复杂度、感知个体化负荷和变换难度来改变串行处理需求，比较人类和VLM的表现。

Result: 所有领域都显示出一致模式：VLM准确率下降与人类反应时间增加（作为串行处理负荷的代理）强相关。任务需要更多串行处理时，VLM与人类性能差距显著扩大。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在串行、视觉基础的推理能力上存在根本性瓶颈，这是区分VLMs与人类的关键因素。

Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks,
often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning
tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we
hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial
processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance
across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct
domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.
Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors
such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and
transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a
consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with
increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As
tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,
enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human
performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,
indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a
fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

TL;DR: UniAPL提出了一种统一的对抗性偏好学习框架，将SFT和RL对齐方法整合到单阶段训练中，解决了传统顺序方法中的分布不匹配问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练对齐方法采用SFT后接RL的顺序流程存在严重问题：SFT使用静态专家数据，而策略演化时生成分布会漂移，导致SFT知识变得脆弱。RL探索时无法直接访问专家演示中的丰富知识，造成效率低下和更新不接地气。

Method: 将对齐重新定义为约束优化问题，提出UniAPL框架，通过单阶段统一训练目标，从混合的SFT和偏好数据批次中联合学习。在每个梯度步骤中，密集的专家演示直接基础和正则化在线探索。

Result: 在指令跟随任务上评估，使用Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507作为教师模型。UniAPL模型匹配或超越了强GRPO基线：Qwen3-0.6B提升5.77%（匹配32B模型），Qwen3-4B提升3.75%，甚至超过了教师模型。

Conclusion: UniAPL通过统一训练框架有效解决了分布不匹配问题，输出紧密模仿专家演示，实现了更强的性能和更好的行为对齐。

Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.
We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference
Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,
Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement
Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due
to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the
policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge
brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,
ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,
ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data
sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization
problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel
framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.
UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning
from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense
expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,
inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We
evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507
as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on
Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the
teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm
that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both
stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的判断存在固有偏见和脆弱性，在学术同行评审等敏感场景中需要区分这些判断，但现有LLM生成文本检测方法无法有效处理判断检测任务。

Method: 提出J-Detector检测器，使用显式提取的语言学和LLM增强特征，将LLM判断者的偏见与候选内容属性联系起来进行检测。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验证明了J-Detector的有效性，其可解释性能够量化LLM判断者的偏见，验证了判断检测在实际场景中的实用性。

Conclusion: 判断检测是可行的，J-Detector能够有效检测LLM生成的判断，并分析影响检测性的关键因素，为敏感场景中的判断质量评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to
efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However,
the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise
concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive
scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize
the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability
of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment
detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting
real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the
detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated
text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the
interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial
for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce
\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented
with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM
judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments
across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector}
and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.
Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated
judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in
real-world scenarios.
